# TR-124: Functional Requirements for Broadband Residential Gateway Devices

*Guidelines and profiles for development and RFPs of broadband gateways
and Wi-Fi routers*

See <https://rg-device-requirements.broadband-forum.org> for the
current TR-124 specification.

TR-124 specifies a superset of requirements for broadband
Residential Gateway (RG) devices that are capable of supporting a full
suite of voice, data, broadcast video, video on demand and two-way video
applications in broadband networks.

The requirements are grouped into modules. This means that an RG can be
specified by listing the modules that the RG is expected to support. No
single device is expected to support all modules.
