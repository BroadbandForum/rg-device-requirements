"summary": |
  See <https://rg-device-requirements.broadband-forum.org> for the
  current TR-124 specification.
"description": |
  TR-124 specifies a superset of requirements for broadband
  Residential Gateway (RG) devices that are capable of supporting a full
  suite of voice, data, broadcast video, video on demand and two-way video
  applications in broadband networks.

  The requirements are grouped into modules. This means that an RG can be
  specified by listing the modules that the RG is expected to support. No
  single device is expected to support all modules.
