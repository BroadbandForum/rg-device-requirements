LAN.QoS:
  name: |
    LAN quality of service requirements

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support classification of LAN directed WAN traffic and
      placement into appropriate queues (or discard) based on any one or more
      of the following pieces of information:

      #. destination IP address(es) with subnet mask,

      #. originating IP address(es) with subnet mask,

      #. Diffserv codepoint ([@RFC3260]),

      #. protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, IGMP ...),

      #. source TCP/UDP port and port range,

      #. destination TCP/UDP port and port range

      In an ATM based access network:

      #. ATM VPI/VCI

      Where Ethernet is present on the access link:

      #. source MAC address,

      #. destination MAC address,

      #. IEEE 802.1Q Ethernet priority,

      #. Ethertype (IEEE 802.3) length/type field), and

      #. IEEE 802.1Q VLAN identification.

    2: |
      The RG SHOULD support classification of LAN directed WAN traffic and
      placement into appropriate queues (or discard) based on any one or more
      of the following pieces of information:

      #. packet length (note: to be used judiciously to avoid out of order
      packet delivery).

    3: |
      The RG MUST support classification of LAN directed traffic and placement
      into appropriate queues (or discard) based on any one or more of the
      following pieces of information:

      (1) source MAC address, and

      (2) destination MAC address.

    4: |
      The RG SHOULD support classification of LAN directed traffic and
      placement into appropriate queues (or discard) based on any one or more
      of the pieces of information defined in WAN.QoS. 1, WAN.QoS. 2, WAN.QoS.
      22 and WAN.QoS. 23.

    5: |
      The RG MUST support classification of LAN directed internally generated
      traffic and placement into appropriate queues based on any one or more
      of information defined in WAN.QoS. 20 and WAN.QoS. 21.

    6: |
      The RG MUST be able to mark or remark the Diffserv codepoint of traffic
      identified based on any of the classifiers supported by the RG.

    7: |
      The RG MUST support a minimum of four downstream queues per LAN port.

    8: |
      The RG MUST duplicate the set of queues for each LAN egress port. This
      can be done logically or physically.

    9: |
      The RG SHOULD be able to configure each queue for strict priority or
      weighted round robin scheduling.

      Strict priority queues are served with priority over all other queues.
      WRR queues are served on the basis of configurable weights.

    10: |
      The RG MUST provide counters in terms of dropped and emitted
      packets/bytes for each queue. Statistics SHOULD be collected from the
      time of last counter reset or on a configurable sample interval.

    11: |
      The RG MUST provide information about queue occupancy in terms of
      packets and peak percentage. Statistics SHOULD be collected from the
      time of last counter reset or on a configurable sample interval.

    12: |
      The RG SHOULD be able to monitor the physical layer rate of the LAN
      interfaces, maintaining information about the current available
      bandwidth and measurement history.
