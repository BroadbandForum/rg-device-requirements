LAN.ADDRESS:
  name: |
    Private IPv4 Addressing

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST be able to be configured to specify alternate public and
      private subnets (without restriction) for local device addressing.

    2: |
      The RG MUST be able to be configured to specify the start and stop
      addresses within a subnet used for local addressing.

    3: |
      The RG MUST NOT use auto IP for address assignment of its LAN-side IPv4
      address.

    4: |
      The RG MUST allow its assigned address and netmask to be specified
      through the Web GUI, Broadband Forum TR-064i2 [@TR-064i2] interfaces and from a Controller.

    5: |
      If the RG is in bridged configuration and LAN-side configuration is
      enabled, the RG MUST ARP on the LAN side for the following addresses, in
      order, and assign itself the first one that is not taken: 192.168.1.254,
      192.168.1.63, and then starting from 192.168.1.253 and descending.

    6: |
      The RG MUST be able to assign its own WAN IPv4 address (i.e. its public
      address) to a particular LAN device, concurrent with private IPv4
      addressing being used for other LAN CPE.

      In this situation, one device on the LAN is given the same public IPv4
      address (through DHCP or manual configuration of the LAN CPE IPv4
      stack). Other LAN devices utilize private IPv4 addresses. The RG can
      then be configured as identified in LAN.PFWD.2 so that the LAN device
      sharing the WAN IPv4 address receives all unidentified or unsolicited
      port traffic to any specific LAN device. If the RG is not configured in
      this manner, then only inbound traffic resulting from outbound traffic
      from the LAN CPE would be directed to that LAN CPE.

      The gateway identified to the LAN device must be on the same subnet as
      that associated with the WAN IPv4 address. Note that the use of the WAN
      gateway address does not guarantee this since it need not meet this
      requirement.

    7: |
      When operating in multiple WAN public IPv4 address mode, the RG MUST
      support up to 16 public IPv4 addresses being used by LAN devices
      (statically or dynamically issued) and whose traffic must be routed to
      and from the public IPv4 address associated with the LAN device.
      Additionally, a transparent basic NAT mapping feature MAY be supported,
      allowing the 16 public addresses to be mapped to a device's private
      address. A user configurable option in the Web GUI MUST be provided to
      enable or disable the firewall on a per public IPv4 address basis. This
      feature must operate concurrently with other LAN usage (e.g. NAPT on the
      gateway's primary IPv4 address).

    8: |
      When using a WAN IPv4 address assigned to a LAN device, the RG MUST be
      able to be configured by the user whether this LAN device can directly
      communicate with other devices on the local LAN without the need to
      traverse the broadband connection.

      This will only be done to the extent to which the RG can control
      isolation (e.g. routing and internal switch fabric). It does not extend
      to isolation external to the RG (e.g. external switch or router), which
      are beyond the control of the RG.
