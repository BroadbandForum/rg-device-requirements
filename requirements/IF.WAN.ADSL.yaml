IF.WAN.ADSL:
  name: |
    ADSL and ADSL2+

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST include an internal ADSL modem.

    2: |
      The RG MUST complete training within the following time frames:

      - 60 seconds, for single mode operation on the default inner pair
      assuming line auto-sensing is not activated, or if auto-sensing is
      activated and ADSL is present on the default pair

      - 120 seconds, for auto-mode operation or for single mode operation if
      line auto-sensing is activated and ADSL is not present on the default
      pair

      - 150 seconds, for DELT-based auto-mode operation on the default inner
      pair assuming that line auto-sensing is not activated.

    3: |
      The RG MUST pass the tests identified in Broadband Forum TR-067 [@TR-067], *ADSL Interoperability
      Test Plan*, and any subsequent updates or replacements to that document
      that exist at the time that the modem is tested, prior to its initial
      deployment. Within 6 months, RGs produced after changed or new test
      requirements have been approved MUST conform to those new requirements.

    4: |
      The RG MUST train and pass data against all ITU-T G.992.1 [@G.992.1] based ATU-C
      deployed in North America using Broadband Forum TR-067 [@TR-067] criteria.

    5: |
      The RG MUST comply with requirements as specified in ANSI T1.413 [@T1.413-1998],
      T1.413a [@T1.413a-2001] and ITU-T G.992.1 [@G.992.1] for Annex A or Annex B depending upon
      regional requirements

    6: |
      The RG MUST support FDM mode per ANSI T1.413 and ITU-T G.992.1 [@G.992.1].

    7: |
      The RG MUST comply with ITU-T G.992.3 [@G.992.3] (ADSL2) and ITU-T G.992.5 [@G.992.5] (ADSL2+).

    8: |
      The RG SHOULD comply with ITU-T G.992.3 [@G.992.3] Annex L (RE-ADSL2).

    9: |
      The RG MUST support trellis coding.

    10: |
      The RG MUST be rate-adaptive and able to support all speeds between the
      minimum and maximum applicable to the associated DSL protocol in use
      (e.g. ADSL, ADSL2, ADSL2+, RE-ADSL, ...) and in the minimum increment
      applicable to the associated DSL protocol in use.

      For example, for ADSL, the RG MUST be able to support speeds in 32 kbps
      increments from 32 kbps to 8 Mbps downstream and 32 kbps to 800 kbps
      upstream.

    11: |
      The RG MUST support dynamic rate adaptation.

    12: |
      The RG MUST support independent upstream and downstream data rate
      provisioning.

    13: |
      The RG MUST support bit swapping.

    14: |
      The RG MUST support both fast and interleaved paths. This is not a
      requirement for dual latency support (e.g. running fast and interleaved
      at the same time to two different locations).

    15: |
      The RG MUST have a high-pass filter at its ADSL line input to prevent
      the ADSL signal from causing noise on premises wiring.

    16: |
      The RG SHOULD NOT incorporate an internal splitter (i.e. SHOULD NOT have
      a POTS passback port).

    17: |
      The default pair used to detect the ADSL signal MUST be the inner pair
      (RJ-11 pins 3 & 4).

    18: |
      The RG SHOULD provide line auto-sensing capabilities to automatically
      detect and select the ADSL signal on either the inner pair (pins 3 & 4)
      or outer pair (pins 2 & 5) of an RJ-11 jack.

      If the modem reaches showtime after performing DSL auto-sensing, the
      default pair will be set to the newly discovered pair. This can be the
      inner pair or the outer pair. The new default pair is stored on the RG
      across power off situations. DSL auto-sensing will be activated with the
      new default pair.

    19: |
      If DSL line auto-sensing is implemented, the RG MUST allow disabling of
      the automatic detection of the ADSL signal on the inner and outer pairs
      and allow specification of which pair to search for the DSL signal.

    20: |
      The RG MUST conform to ANSI T1.413 [@T1.413-1998] section 7.4.1.3 CRC
      requirements.

    21: |
      The RG MUST support remote testing, remote diagnostics, performance
      monitoring, surveillance information access and other information access
      as identified in ANSI T1.413 [@T1.413-1998] and ITU-T G.997.1 [@G.997.1]. At a minimum
      non-optional requirements from these standards MUST be supported.

    22: |
      The RG MUST provide detailed information for current connections and
      associated parameters including ADSL sync rate, power for both upstream
      and downstream directions, FEC error count, CRC error count, line
      attenuation, signal-to-noise margins, relative capacity of line, trained
      bit rate, graph of bits per tone, and loss of signal, loss of frame and
      loss of power counts.
