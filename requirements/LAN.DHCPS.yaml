    DHCPv4 Server

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST provide application layer support for host name mapping,
      booting, and management including DHCPv4 and the Domain Name System
      (DNS) protocol. This includes support for the standards below:

      * RFC 1034 [@RFC1034] Domain Names -- Concepts and Facilities

      * RFC 1035 [@RFC1035] Domain Names -- Implementation and Specification

      * RFC 2131 [@RFC2131] Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

      * RFC 2132 [@RFC2132] DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions

      * RFC 2181 [@RFC2181] Clarifications to the DNS Specification

      * RFC 2939 [@RFC2939] Procedures and IANA Guidelines for Definition of New
      DHCP Options and Message Types

    2: |
      The RG MUST be a DHCPv4 server to local LAN devices, supporting all LAN
      devices.

    3: |
      The embedded DHCPv4 server function of the RG MUST be able to operate
      while in bridged mode. The default state should be on in bridged and
      routed mode.

    4: |
      The RG MUST support a minimum of 253 LAN devices.

    5: |
      The RG MUST support turning off the embedded DHCPv4 server via a
      configuration change via the Web GUI, TR-064i2 interfaces and from a
      Controller.

    6: |
      The RG MAY incorporate auto-detection of other DHCPv4 servers on the
      local LAN and, if configured to do so, disable the internal DHCPv4
      server functionality of the RG in this situation.

      In this situation, the RG would try to obtain a configuration for its
      LAN port through DHCPv4. If a DHCPv4 response was received, the RG would
      then use the information in the DHCPv4 response (e.g. IPv4 address,
      subnet and DNS information) and disable its internal DHCPv4 server. If
      implemented and a DHCPv4 response is received, this requirement takes
      precedence over requirement LAN.DHCPS.15.

    7: |
      The embedded DHCPv4 server functionality of the RG MUST verify that an
      address is not in use prior to making it available in a lease (e.g. via
      ping or ARP table validation) even when lease information shows that it
      is not in use.

    8: |
      If the RG is in a routed configuration (i.e. full NAPT router), the RG
      MUST use the default start address 192.168.1.64 and the default stop
      address 192.168.1.253 for assignment to DHCPv4 leases for local device
      addressing, or use an operator-specific configuration.

    9: |
      If the RG is in a routed configuration (i.e. full NAPT router), the RG
      MUST use a default netmask of 255.255.255.0 for assignment to DHCPv4
      leases for local device addressing, or use an operator-specific
      configuration.

    10: |
      If the RG is in a bridged configuration for LAN device traffic
      (i.e. NAT/NAPT is not enabled), the RG MUST support the enabling and
      configuration of the local RG DHCPv4 server (address range and subnet
      mask) remotely from a Controller. This address range may be either
      public or private addresses (assuming that the service provider is
      providing the NAT/NAPT function in the network).

      Note that this assumes that a separate management IP (v4 or v6)
      interface has been established to the RG expressly for the purpose of
      CWMP or USP remote management.

    11: |
      The default lease time for DHCPv4 information provided to LAN CPE that
      do not share the WAN side IPv4 address MUST be configurable. The default
      value MUST be 24 hours, or use an operator-specific configuration.

    12: |
      The default lease time for DHCPv4 information provided to LAN CPE that
      share the WAN side IPv4 address MUST be configurable. The default value
      MUST be 10 minutes, or use an operator-specific configuration.

    13: |
      When the domain name that the embedded DHCPv4 server passes to LAN CPE
      has not been set, the value "domain_not_set.invalid" SHOULD be used.

    14: |
      If the RG is in a routed configuration (i.e. full NAPT router) and the
      RG's embedded DHCPv4 server is enabled, the RG itself MUST default to
      the address 192.168.1.254 (with a netmask of 255.255.255.0), or use an
      operator-specific configuration.

    15: |
      When the RG's embedded DHCPv4 server is disabled, the RG MUST ARP for
      the following addresses, in order, and assign itself the first one that
      is not taken: 192.168.1.254, 192.168.1.63, and then starting from
      192.168.1.253 and descending.

    16: |
      The RG MAY allow the embedded DHCPv4 server to be configured so that
      specific MAC addresses can be identified as being served or not served.

    17: |
      The RG MAY allow the embedded DHCPv4 server to be configured with a
      default setting (provide IPv4 addresses or not provide IPv4 addresses)
      for devices whose MAC addresses have not been specified in accordance
      with LAN.DHCPS.16.

    18: |
      The embedded DHCPv4 server functionality of the RG SHOULD provide a
      mechanism by which an IPv4 address can be assigned to a particular LAN
      device by MAC address. The user interface to establish this association
      may use an alternate mechanism to identify this assignment (e.g. by
      selecting the device using its current IPv4 address or device name) and
      the MAC address may be transparent to the user. These addresses may
      include addresses within the default subnet or addresses from additional
      public/private subnets that may be provisioned.

      For example, the RG might have a default WAN side IPv4 address that is
      used for NAPT to a subset of devices and an additional set of WAN side
      IPv4 addresses that are bridged. The embedded DHCPv4 server might be
      used to assign this second set of IPv4 addresses to specific LAN CPE.

    19: |
      The RG MUST support a single PC mode of operation. In this mode of
      operation only a single LAN device is supported. Note that this is not
      the default mode of operation.

      In this configured mode, all network traffic, except for configured
      management traffic destined for the RG itself (e.g. temporary remote
      access to the Web GUI) MUST be passed between the access network and the
      designated LAN device as if the RG was not present.

      One possible implementation is for the embedded DHCPv4 server to issue
      one and only one private address in this situation, with the start and
      stop addresses for the embedded DHCPv4 server being the same.

      The LAN devices can be assigned either a private IPv4 address
      (i.e. using 1:1 NAT) or the public IPv4 address of the RG (i.e. using IP
      pass-through as identified in requirement LAN.ADDRESS.6). The type of
      IPv4 address to be used (private or public) is configured through the
      Web GUI, TR-064i2 interfaces and from a Controller. The default is a
      public IPv4 address.

      If a WAN connection is not available when the RG is configured to use a
      public IPv4 address, the RG provides a private IPv4 address to the LAN
      device via DHCPv4. Once a WAN connection is established, the public IPv4
      address provided by the broadband network is passed to the LAN device
      during the next DHCPv4 lease renewal.

      The RG acts as the default gateway to the LAN devices when private IPv4
      addressing is in use. When public IPv4 addressing is in use, the gateway
      identified to the LAN device should be that identified in requirement
      LAN.ADDRESS.6 above.

      No other restrictions (e.g. restricted routing for other devices) need
      to be implemented to meet this requirement (e.g. no routing restrictions
      on traffic from secondary devices on the LAN).

    20: |
      If the RG is configured in a routed configuration (i.e. full NAPT
      router), the RG MUST operate by default in the multiple PC mode of
      operation, or use an operator-specific configuration.
