  requirements:
    1: |
      The VLAN ID used for NAS, AS and 5WE encapsulated sessions MUST be able
      to be locally configured. Note: This is known as the 5G VLAN.

    2: |
      The default VLAN ID used for NAS, AS and 5WE encapsulated PDU sessions
      is zero indicating an untagged or priority tagged UNI.

    3: |
      The RG MUST support the procedures documented in Broadband Forum TR-456 [@TR-456] section
      'Procedure Call Flows' subsection 'For a 5G-RG' and 3GPP TS 24.501 [@3GPP-TS.24.501].

  after: |
    *Note: A number of NAS procedures have error conditions that
    mandate the 5G-RG NAS implementation 'back off' for a period of time
    prior to re-attempting the operation. The set of procedures that result
    in these conditions is documented in 3GPP TS 24.501 [@3GPP-TS.24.501]. The relevance of
    these various error, resource or subscription issue conditions to a
    5G-RG in relation to the set of timers associated with NAS operations is
    discussed in Appendix 9.1 of Broadband Forum TR-456 [@TR-456].*
