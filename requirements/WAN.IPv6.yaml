WAN.IPv6:
  name: |
    IPv6 WAN Connection

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support automated establishment of an IPv6 connection
      according to the flow in Annex A.2.

    2: |
      The RG MUST support a dual stack of IPv4 and IPv6 running
      simultaneously, as described in section 2 of RFC 4213 [@RFC4213].

    3: |
      The RG MUST allow the IPv6 stack to be enabled / disabled.

    4: |
      The RG MUST support DHCPv6 client messages and behavior per IETF RFC
      []{} 3315. See WAN.DHCPC.5 for further specifics on IAID value.

    5: |
      The RG MUST support the role of the CPE requesting router in RFC 3633 [@RFC3633].

    6: |
      The RG MUST support specifying in its DHCPv6 prefix delegation request
      an indication of the length of prefix it requires. If the RG supports
      multiple LANs, or has PD requests from its LAN, it MUST indicate a
      preferred prefix length that would at least enable the RG to assign a
      /64 prefix to each LAN it supports. Note that the delegated prefix may
      vary from the requested length.

    7: |
      When sending DHCPv6 messages, the RG MUST identify itself in
      OPTION_CLIENTID (1) (client-identifier) using the same client identifier
      as for IPv4 (see WAN.DHCPC.3 and .4).

    8: |
      The RG MUST support IPv6 node requirements as a host node, per RFC 6434
      [@RFC6434].

    9: |
      The RG MUST support stateless address auto-configuration (SLAAC) as a
      host, per RFC 4862 [@RFC4862].

    10: |
      The RG MUST support receipt of route information per RFC 4191 [@RFC4191]. If the RG
      only has one WAN connection, it does not need to place this information
      in its routing table, but it does need to save it (for possible
      forwarding on the LAN interface).

    11: |
      If route information is provided (RFC 4191 [@RFC4191]) and the RG has multiple WAN
      connections, it MUST place the route information in its routing table.

    12: |
      If the RG does not have a globally-scoped address on its WAN interface
      after having been delegated a prefix, it MUST create addresses for
      itself from the delegated prefix. It MUST have at least one address and
      MAY have more.

      There is currently no algorithm defined for address creation. It should
      be assumed that different service providers will want different rules
      for how to create the address, how many addresses to create, and in the
      case of multiple addresses, how the different addresses are used.

    13: |
      *Requirement deleted; redundant with WAN.IPv6.3*

    14: |
      The RG MUST be able to request the following DHCPv6 options: IA_NA (RFC
      3315), reconfigure accept (RFC 3315 [@RFC3315]), IA_PD (RFC 3633 [@RFC3633]), and DNS_SERVERS
      ([@RFC3646]).

    15: |
      The RG SHOULD be able to request the following DHCPv6 options:
      SNTP_SERVERS ([@RFC4075]), domain search list ([@RFC3646]), and Client FQDN
      ([@RFC4704]).

    16: |
      The RG MUST be configurable as to which DHCPv6 options it requests via
      DHCPv6.

    17: |
      The connectivity parameters (obtained via RA and DHCPv6) MUST persist
      across loss of WAN connection (or lack of response from WAN connection).

    18: |
      The RG MUST continue to use the connectivity parameters (obtained via RA
      or DHCP) and consider them valid until either they expire or the RG is
      explicitly told to use different values.

    19: |
      The RG MUST NOT advertise any address prefixes on the WAN using the IPv6
      neighbor discovery protocol, or advertise itself as a default router.

    20: |
      The RG MUST provide up to 4 instances of option-data within a single
      OPTION_VENDOR_OPTS (17) (RFC 3315 [@RFC3315]) with IANA "ADSL Forum" Enterprise
      Number as the enterprise-number. Each instance will have one of the 4
      sub-options from WAN.DHCPC.7 as the vendor-specific opt-code, with the
      corresponding value in the vendor-specific option-data. If the value of
      a parameter is empty for the RG, then the sub-option MUST be omitted. If
      there are no values to provide, the entire option MUST be omitted.

    21: |
      The RG SHOULD be able to request the following DHCPv6 options: address
      selection policy ([@RFC7078]) and DNS selection policy ([@RFC6731]).

    22: |
      If route information is provided (draft-ietf-mif-dhcpv6-route-option)
      and the RG has multiple WAN connections, it MUST place the route
      information in its routing table.

    23: |
      The RG SHOULD generate address selection policy based on policies
      obtained from each WAN link by DHCPv6 option
      (draft-ietf-6man-addr-select-opt) or manually configured policy.

    24: |
      The RG MUST be able to request DHCPv6 option OPTION_NTP_SERVER(56)
      for NTP server information as per RFC 5908 [@RFC5908].

    25: |
      To obtain the local time zone, the RG SHOULD be able to request one of the following
      DHCPv6 options: OPTION_NEW_POSIX_TIMEZONE(41) or OPTION_NEW_TZDB_TIMEZONE(42)
      in accordance with RFC 4833 [@RFC4833].
