    IPv6 stack

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST drop or deny IPv4 access requests from WAN side connections
      to LAN side devices and to the RG itself except in direct response to
      outgoing traffic or as explicitly permitted through configuration of the
      RG (e.g. for port forwarding or management).

    2: |
      The RG MUST support a separate firewall log to maintain records of
      transactions according to firewall rules.

      The firewall log file MUST be able to hold at least the last 100 entries
      or 10 Kbytes of text.

    4: |
      Firewall log entries SHOULD NOT be cleared except when the RG is reset
      to its factory default settings.

    5: |
      The RG MUST timestamp each firewall log entry.

    6: |
      The RG MUST support the definition of IPv6 firewall rules separate from
      IPv4.
