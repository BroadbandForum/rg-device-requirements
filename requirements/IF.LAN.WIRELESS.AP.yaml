  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG SHOULD have the ability to mitigate interference generated by
      wireless and other devices operating in the same or neighboring
      frequencies by using interference cancellation, management or antenna
      techniques.

    2: |
      The RG MUST have the ability to scan the frequency spectrum and select
      the best channel upon RESET and power on.

    3: |
      The RG MAY have the ability to perform interference detection
      dynamically and automatically switch to the best available channel.
      Interference detection techniques if implemented MUST NOT affect normal
      operation, performance or availability of the wireless function.

    4: |
      The RG's Wi-Fi (802.11) access point MUST be able to have the
      channel configured to a fixed value selectable through the web GUI.

    5: |
      The RG MUST allow the user to select which LAN devices are allowed to
      access it through the wireless interface (i.e. MAC address filtering).
      By default, this restriction must be disabled.

    6: |
      The RG Web GUI MUST provide indicators regarding the operational status
      of the wireless LAN and devices accessing the RG using the wireless
      interface. This includes but is not limited to the data elements below.

      For the AP RG itself, the following are the minimum required data
      elements (some may be per SSID if multiple SSIDs are supported):

      * SSID(s)

      * SSID broadcast status

      * radio/SSID MAC address (if different from residential gateway)

      * IEEE 802.11b only, 802.11g only 802.b/g mixed mode selection

      * maximum power level

      * configured data rate(s)

      * supported data rate(s)

      * authentication information

      * encryption information

      * key management information

      * current signal strength

      * radio status (disabled, enabled)

      * current radio channel

      * radio channel selection (fixed, automatic, etc...)

      * ERP-PBCC status (if supported; enabled, disabled)

      * DSSS-OFDM status (if supported; enabled, disabled)

      * packets transmitted

      * errored packets transmitted

      * packets received

      * errored packets received

      * devices connected

      * VLAN identification

      * DSCP identification

      For each wireless client connected to the RG AP, the following are the
      minimum required data elements:

      * SSID used

      * authentication used

      * encryption used

      * connection state

      * connected device rate

      * protocol used (IEEE 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n)

    7: |
      The RG MUST be Wi-Fi CERTIFIED for all applicable IEEE 802.11 standards
      supported by the RG.

    8: |
      *Requirement moved to own subsection* *4.5.2.4.1.2.*

    9: |
      *Requirement moved to own subsection* *4.5.2.4.1.2.*

    10: |
      The RG MUST be Wi-Fi CERTIFIED for Protected Setup as an AP type device
      with registrar support.

    11: |
      The RG MUST support the Wi-Fi Protected Setup push button method and
      MUST include a physical pushbutton and corresponding indicator light.

    12: |
      The RG MUST implement a Wi-Fi Protected Setup registrar user interface
      in the Web GUI to allow users to enter Wi-Fi device Protected Setup PIN
      codes.

    13: |
      The RG MUST be Wi-Fi CERTIFIED for WMM (Wi-Fi Multimedia subset function
      of IEEE 802.11e [@802.11]).

    14: |
      The RG MAY be Wi-Fi CERTIFIED for WMM Scheduled Access.

    15: |
      The RG MUST be Wi-Fi CERTIFIED for WMM-PS.

    16: |
      A minimum of 32 devices (without traffic) MUST be able to simultaneously
      connect to the AP of the RG.

    17: |
      *Requirement moved to own subsection* *4.5.2.4.1.1*

    18: |
      *Requirement moved to own subsection* *4.5.2.4.1.1*

    19: |
      The RG MUST support both entry of hexadecimal encryption keys for use
      with WEP and ASCII based pass phrases for use with WPA.

    20: |
      Wireless MUST be enabled by default on the RG using a unique
      authentication/encryption key and relatively unique SSID name
      (e.g. "SSIDNAME1234" where the digits represent the last four digits of
      the RG serial number), or use an operator-specific configuration.

    21: |
      The SSID and key MUST be printed on a label on the bottom of the RG, or
      use an operator-specific packaging requirement.

    22: |
      The RG MUST allow disabling the broadcasting of the primary user SSID
      via the Web GUI. By default broadcasting MUST be enabled.

    23: |
      By default, the RG MUST block association requests that do not specify a
      valid SSID. That is, the RG MUST block association requests that probe
      for "any" SSID.

    24a: |
      The RG SHOULD be able to simultaneously support at least four separate
      SSIDs.

    24b: |
      Each SSID SHOULD have its own unique characteristics including protocol
      configuration, data rate supported, authentication, encryption and
      broadcasting status. These SHOULD be used in combination with forwarding
      and firewall mechanisms in the RG to direct traffic to specific
      connections and destinations.

    25: |
      The RG MUST support a mechanism based on source SSID of incoming
      wireless traffic of setting the Differentiated Services Code Point
      (DSCP) in the IP header as defined in RFC 2474 [@RFC2474].

    26: |
      The RG MUST support setting the Ethernet VLAN identifier, defined in
      IEEE 802.1Q [@802.1Q], of incoming wireless traffic to a configurable value based
      on SSID.

    27: |
      The RG MUST comply with regional regulations.

    28: |
      The RG MUST support the adjustment of transmitted radio power level
      manually or automatically.

    30: |
      The RG MUST be provisioned with only one advertised SSID by default.
