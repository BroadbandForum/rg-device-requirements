IF.WAN.xDSL.SURGE:
  name: |
    AC Power Surge Protection

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST tolerate an AC surge, as specified in EN 61000-4-5, test
      level 3;

      * Criterion 1: The RG MUST NOT -- as a result of the surge -- transmit
      or receive bit errors for more than 2 seconds.

      * Criterion 2: The RG MUST NOT -- as a result of the surge --
      re-initialize.

      * Criterion 3: The RG MUST NOT -- as a result of the surge -- transmit
      a dying gasp message.

    2: |
      The RG MUST tolerate electrical fast transients on the AC mains, as
      specified in EN 61000-4-4, test level 3:

      * Criterion 1: The RG MUST NOT -- as a result of electrical fast
      transients -- transmit or receive bit errors at a rate greater than
      10E-7 (care should be taken to ensure that fast transients are not
      coupled to the DSL pair).

      * Criterion 2: The RG MUST NOT -- as a result of electrical fast
      transients -- re-initialize.

      * Criterion 3: The RG MUST NOT -- as a result of electrical fast
      transients -- transmit a dying gasp message.
