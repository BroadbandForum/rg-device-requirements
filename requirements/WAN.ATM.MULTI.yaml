WAN.ATM.MULTI:
  name: |
    ATM Multi-PVC

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support eight PVCs. This is in addition to support for any
      implemented ATM UNI control path PVCs (e.g. ILMI auto-configuration PVC,
      etc.).

    2: |
      The RG MUST allow the protocol stack (e.g. IP over Ethernet, PPPoE,
      PPPoA, etc.) for each provisioned PVC to be defined separately. If
      necessary, each PVC can use a different stack and set of protocols.

    3: |
      There is no default defined VPI/VCI for additional PVCs past the primary
      PVC defined in WAN.ATM above. The RG MUST support auto-search function
      (see WAN.ATM.16 through 19) on all PVCs and will use the same
      auto-search sequence identified (skipping over any already in use).

    4: |
      The RG MUST NOT require the same VPI value for all supported PVCs.

    5: |
      All supported PVCs MUST be able to be active and sending/receiving
      traffic simultaneously. See requirements LAN.FWD.9, 10, 11 and 15 for
      more details on interface selection for routing.

    6: |
      The RG MUST support the minimum ATM granularity applicable to the
      associated DSL protocol in use on a per VC and VP basis.

      For example, ATM granularity of 32 kbps MUST be supported for ADSL on a
      per VC and VP basis.

    7: |
      The RG MUST use the same Ethernet MAC address for all interfaces over
      the same AAL5/ATM/DSL connection.

    8: |
      The RG MUST support multiple levels of CoS simultaneously across
      separate VCCs (e.g. UBR for PVC 0/35 and CBR for PVC 0/43 where both
      PVCs are active simultaneously).
