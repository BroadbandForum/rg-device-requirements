WAN.TRANS.DS-Lite:
  name: |
    Dual Stack Lite Transition Mechanism

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support DS-Lite (RFC 6333 [@RFC6333]) with IPv4 in IPv6 encapsulation
      (RFC 2473 [@RFC2473]).

    2: |
      *This requirement replaced by requirement WAN.TRANS.DS-Lite.6.*

    3: |
      The RG MUST configure a static IPv4 default route toward the DS-Lite
      tunnel.

    4: |
      The RG MUST deactivate the NAPT function on the DS-Lite interface.

    5: |
      The RG MUST support enabling and disabling of DS-Lite.

    6: |
      The RG MUST be able to use the DHCPv6 option to retrieve the FQDN of the
      AFTR element, as defined in RFC 6334 [@RFC6334].

    7: |
      Manual configuration on the RG of the FQDN or the IPv6 address of the
      AFTR element SHOULD be supported.

    8: |
      Remote configuration from a Controller of the FQDN or the IPv6 address
      of the AFTR element SHOULD be supported.

    9: |
      The RG MUST support configurable precedence between the FQDN and the
      IPv6 address.

    10: |
      The RG MUST support configurable precedence between dynamic or static
      configuration of the IPv6 address of the AFTR element when both are
      available. The RG MUST use DHCPv6 by default or use an operator-specific
      configuration.
