LAN.FW.SPI:
  name: |
    Firewall (Advanced)

  description: |
    This module applies to IPv6 as well as IPv4, but only if the RG has an
    IPv6 stack.

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support a more robust firewall, such as one that provides a
      full OSI 7 layer stack stateful packet inspection and packet filtering
      function.

    2: |
      The RG SHOULD provide protection for the following:

      * Port scans

      * Packets with same source and destination addresses

      * Packets with a broadcast source address

      * Downstream packets with a LAN source address

      * Invalid fragmented IP (v4 or v6) packets

      * Fragmented TCP packets

      * Packets with invalid TCP flag settings (NULL, FIN, Xmas, etc.)

      * Fragmented packet headers (TCP, UDP and ICMP)

      * Inconsistent packet header lengths

      * Packet flooding

      * Excessive number of sessions

      * Invalid ICMP requests

      * Irregular sequence differences between TCP packets

      The extent of this protection will be limited when the RG is configured
      as a bridge in which only PPPoE traffic is bridged. This protection MUST
      be available when the RG terminates IP (v4 or v6) or bridges IPv4.

    3: |
      Each type of attack for which protection is provided SHOULD be
      configurable on the RG and be on by default.

    4: |
      The RG MUST support passing and blocking of traffic by user-defined and
      TR-181 configurable rules.

    5: |
      The RG MUST support setting firewall rules by an Controller that cannot
      be altered by the user. If firewall rules are set via security policies
      in TR-181i2 profiles, or via other mechanisms such as Controller file
      download, the rules MUST NOT be able to be overridden by user firewall
      rules.

    6: |
      The RG MUST support the user temporarily disabling specific user-defined
      rules or all user defined rules, that is, without deleting the rules.

    7: |
      The RG MUST support the user specifying the order in which firewall
      rules are processed.

      Note: not all firewall rules need be included under the scope of this
      requirement.

    8: |
      The RG SHOULD support specification of any of the following in a
      firewall rule:

      * destination IP (v4 or v6) address(es) with subnet mask

      * originating IP (v4 or v6) address(es) with subnet mask

      * source MAC address

      * destination MAC address

      * protocol (0-255, or by alias: TCP, UDP, ICMP, IP, IGMP, eigrp, gre,
      ipinip, pim, nos, ospf, ...)

      * source port

      * destination port

      * IEEE 802.1Q user priority

      * FQDN (fully qualified domain name) of WAN session

      * DiffServ codepoint ([@RFC3260])

      * Ethertype (IEEE 802.3) length/type field)

      * Traffic matching an ALG filter

      * IEEE 802.1Q VLAN identification

      * packet length

      * TCP flags (urg, ack, psh, rst, syn, fin)

      * IP option values (potentially name aliases)

      * logical interface of source

      * logical interface of destination

    9: |
      The RG MAY support filtering based on other fields unique to specific
      protocols.

    10: |
      The RG SHOULD support firewall rules that support generic pattern
      matching against the header or data payload of traffic. Logically this
      can be envisioned as:

        * match(header\[offset\[,length\|max\]\], condition)

        * match(payload\[offset\[,length\|max\]\], condition)

        where condition is (relationship, data) such as:

        * (=, ne, all, one, and, or) for a hex field

        * (=, ne, gt, ge, lt, le) for a decimal/hex field

        * (=, ne, contains) for a string field

    11: |
      The RG SHOULD support a set of predefined rules to which the user can
      set or reset the firewall settings.

    12: |
      If a set of predefined rules has been set on the RG, the RG rule set
      SHOULD be able to be used as the basis for a user maintained set of
      firewall rules.

    13: |
      In addition to blocking or passing traffic identified by a firewall
      filter, the RG MUST support other actions as well, including but not
      limited to:

      * logging on success or failure,

      * notification on success or failure (to email or pager if supported),

      * sending notification to a PC monitor application (either originator
      and or centralized source), and

      * requesting verification from a PC monitor application.

    14: |
      The RG MUST allow for configuration of global firewall values.

    15: |
      The RG firewall SHOULD be either ICSA certified
      ([*www.icsalabs.com*](http://www.icsalabs.com/)) or be able to display
      all the attributes necessary for ICSA certification for the current
      version of either the Residential category or the Small/Medium Business
      (SMB) category.

    16: |
      Unless configured otherwise, DOS, port blocking and stateful packet
      inspection MUST be provided to all LAN devices receiving traffic from
      the WAN interface.
