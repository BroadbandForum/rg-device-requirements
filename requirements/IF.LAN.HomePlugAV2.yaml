IF.LAN.HomePlugAV2:
  name: |
    IF.LAN.HomePlugAV2- HomePlug AV2 (LAN)

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST comply with the HomePlug AV2 Specification. Information
      regarding the
      specification is available only to members of the HomePlug Powerline
      Alliance; further details can be obtained from the alliance at
      <http://www.homeplug.org>.

    2: |
      The RG MUST support one of the following connector options for
      HomePlug:

      #. Powerline

      #. F-connector type coaxial connector (note this is not formally an
      option with HomePlug alliance but is supported by vendor
      implementations)

      #. Both a & b hybrid configuration using coaxial or simultaneous mode by
      switch or relay

    3: |
      If option c) is supported in IF.LAN.HomePlugAV2.2, the HomePlug
      interface connector type MUST be configurable and persistent across RG
      restarts and reboots. This parameter MUST be independent of the
      configuration settings that may be in use by other HomePlug devices on
      the local LAN.

    4: |
      The RG MUST periodically collect Ethernet layer and channel performance
      data from HomePlug devices in the HomePlug network and report the data
      via Web GUI, Broadband Forum TR-064i2 [@TR-064i2] interfaces and from a Controller.

    5: |
      Ethernet layer performance data MUST be associated with the individual
      device's information:

      - HomePlug device MAC address

    6: |
      The RG MUST collect HomePlug network utilization information based on RG
      utilization and network idle time and report the data via Web GUI,
      Broadband Forum TR-064i2 [@TR-064i2] interfaces and from a Controller.

    7: |
      The RG MUST support configuring a custom Security Key Password.

    8: |
      The RG MUST be able to collect performance monitoring data from other
      devices on the powerline network and report the data via Web GUI,
      Broadband Forum TR-064i2 [@TR-064i2] interfaces and from a Controller.

    9: |
      The RG MUST enable provisioning of the specific HomePlug device from
      which performance monitoring data will be collected via Web GUI,
      Broadband Forum TR-064i2 [@TR-064i2] interfaces and from a Controller.

    10: |
      The RG MUST implement sufficient filtering and isolation so that the
      HomePlug and xDSL interfaces, and the HomePlug and Ethernet interfaces
      will not interfere with each other.

    11: |
      The RG MUST support layer 2 relative QoS on the HomePlug interface.

    12: |
      The RG MUST be able to prioritize network traffic based on at least
      Diffserv code points and IEEE 802.1q [@802.1Q] user priorities for relative QoS.

    13: |
      The RG SHOULD support layer 2 guaranteed QoS on the HomePlug interface.

    14: |
      The RG SHOULD be able to reserve bandwidth (media access time) on the
      network for services requesting QoS guarantees so as to meet QoS
      requirements for throughput (rate), latency and jitter.

    15: |
      The RG SHOULD enable provisioning of QoS classification filters and
      traffic specifications in the HomePlug device.

    16: |
      The RG MUST implement the simple connect functionality of section 13.2.4
      of the HomeplugAV2 specification.
