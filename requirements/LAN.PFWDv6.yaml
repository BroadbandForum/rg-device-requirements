    LAN.PFWDv6- Port Forwarding (IPv6)

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support security mechanisms described in RFC 6092 [@RFC6092].

    2: |
      Individual port forwarding rules MUST be associated with a LAN device,
      not the IPv6 address of the LAN device, and follow the LAN device should
      its IPv6 address change.

    3: |
      The port forwarding mechanism of the RG SHOULD be easy to configure for
      common applications and user protocols (e.g. ftp, http, etc.) by
      specifying a protocol name or application name in a "Common Applications
      Names List" instead of a port number and protocol type. A partial list
      of applications for potential inclusion appears in Appendix I.

    4: |
      The RG SHOULD NOT apply RFC 6092 [@RFC6092] security mechanisms to traffic
      associated with prefixes it has delegated to other routers inside the
      LAN.
