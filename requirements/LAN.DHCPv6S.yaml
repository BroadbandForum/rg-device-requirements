LAN.DHCPv6S:
  name: |
    DHCPv6 Server

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support DHCPv6 server messages and behavior per RFC 3315 [@RFC3315].

    2: |
      The RG MUST support and be configurable to enable/disable address
      assignment using DHCPv6.

    3: |
      The RG MUST either have an algorithm or allow configuration (or both) as
      to which /64 prefix to use, from any received WAN prefixes or its own
      ULA prefix.

    4: |
      The RG SHOULD be configurable to support rules as to which host devices
      will be assigned addresses through DHCPv6. That is, it should be
      possible for a service provider to place its own host devices at the
      customer premises and have the RG only support DHCPv6 address assignment
      to those devices. Note that this does not require use of the RA "M"
      flag, as the service provider host devices can be configured to always
      use DHCPv6 for address assignment. The DUID may help to identify host
      devices.

    5: |
      The RG MUST be configurable to enable/disable prefix delegation via
      DHCPv6.

    6: |
      The RG MUST support delegation of any received WAN prefix and its own
      ULA prefix, that is shorter than /64, using mechanisms of RFC 3633 [@RFC3633].

    7: |
      The WAN / ULA prefixes that an RG is allowed to further delegate SHOULD
      be configurable.

    8: |
      The RG MUST support DHCPv6 Information_request messages.

    9: |
      The RG MUST support the following DHCPv6 options: IA_NA ([@RFC3315]),
      IA_PD ([@RFC3633]), and DNS_SERVERS ([@RFC3646]).

    10: |
      The RG SHOULD support Reconfigure Accept ([@RFC3315]) and pass the
      additional set of DHCP options received from the DHCP client on its WAN
      interface to IPv6 hosts.

    11: |
      The options that the RG will provide via DHCPv6 MUST be configurable.

    12: |
      If address selection policy option is requested in a DHCPv6 request from
      hosts, the RG SHOULD advertise the generated address selection policy
      (see WAN.IPv6.21).
