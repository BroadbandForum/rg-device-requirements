WAN.CONNECT:
  name: |
    Connection Establishment

  description: |
    *Note that this module applies to IPv6 connections as well as IPv4, but
    only if the RG has an IPv6 stack.*

  categories:
    - !include WAN.CONNECT.ON-DEMAND.yaml

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support an "always on" mode for connections. In this mode
      the RG MUST NOT time out connection sessions (ATM, IP and PPP) and MUST
      automatically re-establish any sessions after disconnection, lease
      expiration or loss and restoration of power.

    2: |
      *Moved to WAN.CONNECT.ON-DEMAND.1 and 4*

    3: |
      The RG MUST support a "manual connect" option for connections. In this
      mode the connection to the broadband network is initiated manually
      through the Web GUI or via

      TR-064i2 request and, by default, terminates only when done so
      explicitly by the user, due to a power loss or when the connection is
      lost.

    4: |
      *Moved to WAN.CONNECT.ON-DEMAND.6*

    5: |
      A manual way of disconnecting without waiting for a connection timeout
      MUST be provided.

    6: |
      *Moved to WAN.CONNECT.ON-DEMAND.7*

    7: |
      The RG MUST follow all standards required to perform an orderly tear
      down of the associated connections involved at the associated network
      levels (e.g. issue a DHCP Release message when using DHCPv4, issue LCP
      Terminate-Request/Terminate-Ack and PADT packet when using PPPoE, etc.)
      and then restart the connections.

    8: |
      The RG MUST detect the loss of communications with a network identified
      DNS server as indicated by a failed query, and log the event.
