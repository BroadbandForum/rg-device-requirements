IF.LAN.USB.PC:
  name: |
    USB (PC)

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG SHOULD have a client USB port (series "B" receptacle), allowing
      it to be a non-powered remote device (i.e. the RG has its own power
      source and does not get power across the USB interface) for a host
      computer.

    2: |
      If the RG has a client USB port, its USB interface MUST appear to the PC
      or other host device to be an Ethernet port (i.e. the PC drivers are
      Ethernet drivers), and not appear as a DSL modem (i.e. the RG MUST NOT
      require device modem drivers on LAN CPE).

    3: |
      If the RG has a client USB port, the USB port MUST be based on the USB
      1.1 (or later) technical specification.

    4: |
      If the RG has a client USB port and USB 2.0 is supported, the USB
      interface MUST still work with a USB 1.1 based USB host controller based
      on the USB 2.0 standard.

    5: |
      Over the USB interface, the RG SHOULD support USB drivers for
      commercially available operating systems for home computers that have
      been released over the past seven years.

    6: |
      If the RG has only one Ethernet port and only one client USB port, the
      RG SHOULD be configurable through the Broadband Forum TR-064i2 [@TR-064i2] interfaces and from a
      Controller so that only the Ethernet or client USB port is to be active
      at any one time. In this configuration, whenever one of the ports is in
      use, the other is disabled. If neither is in use, both are enabled. The
      default configuration of the RG SHOULD be that both ports are active at
      the same time.

    7: |
      If the RG has a client USB port, the USB port SHOULD support USB 3.x.
