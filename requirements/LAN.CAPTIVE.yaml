LAN.CAPTIVE:
  name: |
    Captive Portal with Web Redirection

  description: |
    This module applies to IPv6 as well as IPv4, but only if the RG has an
    IPv6 stack.

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support a redirect function, which, when enabled, intercepts
      WAN destination IP (v4 or v6) HTTP requests and responds to these by
      substituting a specified URL in place of the web page request.

      The URL, as well as a list of locations for which this redirect would be
      bypassed (i.e. white list), MUST be settable from a Controller.

      The actual captive portal to be redirected to may be established at the
      time the white list is defined or the white list may be defined first
      and the captive portal specified at a later time.

    2: |
      The redirection function and associated fields MUST NOT be modifiable by
      the subscriber.

    3: |
      The RG MUST support turning on and off the redirect function when the
      captive portal URL field is populated and cleared respectively by the
      Controller.

    4: |
      All port 80 traffic, excluding that associated with the white list, MUST
      be redirected when the redirect function is turned on in the RG.

    5: |
      To specify the captive portal, the RG must accept an IPv4 or IPv6
      address or a URL whose length does not exceed 2000 characters.

    6: |
      The redirect white list MUST support 512 separate list entries, each of
      which can be an individual IP (v4 or v6) address, a range of IPv4
      addresses, an IPv6 prefix, or any combination thereof. For a range of
      IPv4 addresses a subnet mask is required.

    7: |
      Variable length subnet masking (VLSM) MUST be supported in the redirect
      white list. For example:

      * Individual IPv4 address:

        * ipaddress or

        * ipaddress/32 or

        * ipaddress 255.255.255.255

      * Range of 64 IPv4 addresses:

        * ipaddress/26 or

        * ipaddress 255.255.192.0

    8: |
      The RG MUST support only one set of captive portal and redirect settings
      at a time. If new settings are needed, the Controller will overwrite
      existing values within the RG.

    9: |
      A valid set of redirect settings MUST be enabled in an RG within five
      seconds of the redirect URL being sent from the Controller.

    10: |
      The redirect function MUST be disabled on the RG within five seconds of
      the captive portal string being cleared in a RG by an empty redirect URL
      being sent from the Controller.

    11: |
      Incremental packet delay through the RG due to white list lookup MUST
      NOT exceed 5 ms.
