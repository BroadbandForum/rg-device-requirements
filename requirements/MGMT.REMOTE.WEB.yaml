    Remote Management (Web Browser)

  description: |
    This module applies to IPv6 as well as IPv4, but only if the RG has an
    IPv6 stack.

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST be able to allow temporary manual remote access to its web
      GUI remotely from the WAN interface.

    2: |
      When temporary WAN side remote access is enabled to the RG, the remote
      access session MUST be started within 20 minutes and the activated
      session MUST time out after 20 minutes of inactivity.

    3: |
      The user MUST be able to specify that the temporary WAN side remote
      access is a read only connection or one that allows for updates. The
      default MUST be read only.

    4: |
      Temporary WAN side remote access MUST NOT allow for changing the RG
      password.

    5: |
      Temporary WAN side remote access MUST be disabled by default.

    6: |
      Temporary WAN side remote access SHOULD be through HTTP over TLS
      (i.e. https using TLS).

    7: |
      The RG SHOULD use a randomly selected port for temporary WAN side remote
      access to prevent hacking of a well-known port.

    8: |
      If a default port is used for temporary WAN side remote access, it MUST
      be 51003.

    9: |
      The user MUST specify a non-blank password to be used for each temporary
      WAN side remote access session. This information MUST NOT be saved
      across sessions.

    10: |
      The User ID for all temporary WAN side remote access sessions, if
      required based on the method of implementation, MUST be "tech" by
      default.

    11: |
      The user MUST be able to change the User ID for all subsequent temporary
      WAN-side remote access sessions.

    12: |
      The RG MUST allow only one temporary WAN side remote access session to
      be active at a time.

    13: |
      Aside from the requirements in this profile, all other direct access to
      the RG from the WAN side MUST be disabled and blocked by default.
