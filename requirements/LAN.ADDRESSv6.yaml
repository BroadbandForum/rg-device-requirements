    LAN.ADDRESSv6- LAN IPv6 Addressing

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST create a Link Local (LL) address for its LAN interface, and
      perform Duplicate Address Discovery (DAD), per RFC 4862 [@RFC4862]. It MUST always
      use the same LL address, even after reboot or power failure.

    2: |
      The RG SHOULD try alternate LL addresses, if DAD fails. The RG vendor
      can define the algorithm to be used in this case.

    3: |
      The RG MUST have a ULA prefix (RFC 4193 [@RFC4193]). It MUST always maintain the
      same prefix, even after reboot or power failure, unless this prefix is
      changed through configuration, in which case it MUST maintain the
      changed value.

    4: |
      The RG MAY allow its ULA prefix to be changed through configuration.

    5: |
      The RG MUST support the ability to enable or disable advertising a /64
      from its ULA prefix through Router Advertisement. When enabled, this /64
      will be included in RA messages, with L=1, A=1, and reasonable timer
      values.

    6: |
      The RG MUST support RFC 4861 [@RFC4861] section 6.2, Router specification
      requirements.

    7: |
      The RG MUST support configuration of the following elements of a Router
      Advertisement: M and O flags (RFC 4861 [@RFC4861]), route information ([@RFC4191]),
      and default router preference (Prf) ([@RFC4191]).

    8: |
      The RG SHOULD support configuration of the following elements of a
      router advertisement: MTU (RFC 4861 [@RFC4861]).

    9: |
      The RG MUST advertise (in RA) a /64 prefix from all prefixes delegated
      via the WAN interface. This will have L=1, A=1, and lifetimes per the
      received (from the WAN) delegation.

    10: |
      The RG SHOULD advertise DNS server using the RDNSS option in Router
      Advertisements (RFC 6106 [@RFC6106]).
