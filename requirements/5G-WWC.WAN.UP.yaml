    5G WWC WAN User Plane

  categories:
    - !include 5G-WWC.WAN.UP.QOS.yaml

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support the 5G WWC User Plane Encapsulation (5WE) as
      specified in RFC 8822 [@RFC8822].

    2: |
      The RG MUST support the IPv4, IPv6, IPv4/v6 and Ethernet PDU session
      types.

    3: |
      The RG MUST use the same MAC address used for the PPPoE control plane
      connection for all PDU sessions.

      *Note: Some ANs populate MAC anti-spoofing tables from the initial PADI
      received from an RG. Therefore for 5G operation the PPPoE control plane
      connection and the 5WE encapsulated PDU sessions are required to use a
      common MAC address*.

    4: |
      The RG MUST use the same AGF MAC address for all PDU Sessions.

    5: |
      The RG MUST silently discard packets received with an unrecognized 5WE
      session ID value.

    6: |
      The RG MUST set the IPv4 MTU for the WAN interface to the minimum of the
      value negotiated using RFC 4638 [@RFC4638] procedures and the IPv4 Link MTU
      parameter that the RG receives in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT
      message.

    7: |
      The RG MUST set the IPv6 MTU for the WAN interface to the minimum of the
      value negotiated using RFC 4638 [@RFC4638] procedures and the MTU parameter that
      the RG receives in IPv6 RA messages received from the SMF.

    8: |
      The RG MUST set the Ethernet MTU for the WAN interface to the minimum of
      the value of the Ethernet Max Frame Payload MTU value received via PCO
      and the RFC 4638 [@RFC4638] negotiated MTU after adjustment for Ethernet header
      size.

      Note: A resulting WAN MTU of less than 1500 bytes is an error. Reporting
      and recover procedures are FFS.

    9: |
      The RG MUST support a minimum WAN MTU of 2k octets, and SHOULD support a
      minimum WAN MTU of 9k octets.
