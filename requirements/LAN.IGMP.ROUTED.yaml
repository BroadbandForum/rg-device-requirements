LAN.IGMP.ROUTED:
  name: |
    IGMP and Multicast in Routed Configurations (IPv4)

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support an IGMP proxy-routing function as defined in RFC 4605
      [@RFC4605]. This satisfies Broadband Forum TR-101 [@TR-101] R-225.

    2: |
      The RG MUST support IGMPv3 as defined in IETF [@RFC3376]. This satisfies
      TR-101 [@TR-101] R-226.

    3: |
      The RG MUST support IGMP proxy-routing with local NAT and firewall
      features including establishing any pin-holes in the firewall for the
      multicast streams received (after join). This satisfies TR-101 [@TR-101] R-227.

    4: |
      When the RG is configured with multiple WAN-facing IPv4 interfaces
      (e.g. PPP or IPoE), the IGMP proxy-routing function MUST be able to
      configure a filter for multicasting upstream IGMP messages to one or
      more interfaces. This satisfies [@TR-101] requirements R-228 and R-229.

    5: |
      When the RG receives an IGMP membership query on a given WAN-facing IPv4
      interface, the IGMP proxy-routing function MUST only send a
      corresponding membership report on this specific interface. This
      satisfies TR-101 [@TR-101] R-230.

    6: |
      The RG SHOULD be able to classify IGMP requests according to source
      IPv4/MAC address or incoming LAN physical port to distinguish between
      multicast services (e.g.Â IPTV and some other best effort Internet
      multicast application). This satisfies TR-101 [@TR-101] R-231.

    7: |
      The RG MUST have a way to suppress the flooding of multicast to all LAN
      devices by only sending the traffic to selected ports/interfaces, either
      through configuration of dedicated ports connecting to multicast hosts
      or IGMP proxy-routing (where the traffic is only sent to host devices
      that have joined the multicast group). This satisfies TR-101 [@TR-101] R-232.

    8: |
      It MUST be possible to configure a WAN-facing IPv4 interface with an
      IPoE encapsulation and no IPv4 address visible by the access network. It
      MUST be possible to receive multicast traffic on such an interface,
      independent of whether upstream IGMP is sent on this interface or not.
      The RG's IGMP proxy-routing function MUST be able to send upstream IGMP
      traffic on such an interface, using an unspecified (0.0.0.0/::) IPv4
      source address. This satisfies TR-101 [@TR-101] requirements R-269, R-270 and
      R-271.

    9: |
      All RG LAN ports and interfaces MUST be capable of processing IGMP
      messages.

    10: |
      The RG SHOULD be able to allow (default) or discard IGMP join requests
      based on the source interface, port and host. This satisfies the
      requirement stated in TR-101 [@TR-101] R-233.

    11: |
      The RG MUST support IGMP snooping per IPv4 bridge to an individual LAN
      addressable port or interface level (each Ethernet port, USB (PC),
      Wi-Fi, etc.). A recommended reference implementation can be found in
      [@RFC4541].

    12: |
      The RG MUST be configurable to prevent sending IGMP messages to the WAN
      interfaces for specified multicast groups or ranges (such as 239.0.0.0
      through 239.255.255.255 for IPv4, which are limited scope or
      administratively scoped addresses).

    13: |
      The RG MUST default to not sending IGMP messages for IPv4 addresses
      239.0.0.0 through 239.255.255.255 to the WAN interfaces. This satisfies
      TR-101 [@TR-101] R-235.

    14: |
      The RG MUST have a join and leave latency less than 20 ms.

      This means that when the RG receives a leave, it must stop sending the
      stream to that device (although it is expected to continue sending to
      other devices that have not left) in less than 20 ms. The RG must not
      wait for the results of a membership query before it stops sending the
      stream. Rather, it must rely on its membership database to know whether
      there are other devices receiving that stream. When the RG receives a
      join, its allocation of the overall time for starting to forward that
      stream must not exceed 20 ms.

      This latency definition handles southbound join/leave; however a
      definition for the northbound join/leave latency will also be useful.
      Also, the northbound as well as southbound latency definition involves a
      tradeoff between multicast system dynamics (lower latency -\> higher
      dynamics) and bandwidth efficiency (low latency -\> better bandwidth
      efficiency). A statistical analysis will be helpful, based on empirical
      TV channel switching dynamics, when available.

    15: |
      The RG MUST support IGMP immediate leave (also known as fast leave) with
      explicit host tracking. This satisfies TR-101 [@TR-101] R-234.

    16: |
      The RG MUST support a minimum of 32 multicast groups.

    17: |
      The RG SHOULD support a minimum of 64 multicast groups.

    18: |
      The RG MUST be configurable to log (on demand) all IGMP messages on both
      the LAN and WAN interfaces.

    19: |
      The RG MUST be able to provide a summary of the current state of IGMP
      group memberships as managed by the RG (e.g. multicast groups and LAN
      devices currently associated with each multicast group).

    20: |
      The RG MUST be able to provide a summary of IGMP activity over specific
      time periods (e.g. previous hour, previous day, since reboot, etc.), per
      multicast stream and per LAN device.

    21: |
      The RG MUST be able to report IGMP statistics and logs through the Web
      GUI, TR-064i2 interfaces and to a Controller.

    22: |
      The RG MUST be capable of supporting LAN to LAN multicast between
      devices on a shared medium, and between devices on separate switched LAN
      interfaces.

    23: |
      The RG MUST be configurable as to how many simultaneous multicast
      streams are allowed from WAN to LAN.
