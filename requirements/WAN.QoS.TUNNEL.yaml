WAN.QoS.TUNNEL:
  name: |
    Quality of Service for Tunneled Traffic

  description: |
    This module only applies when the RG is an endpoint for a tunnel to the
    WAN. This module applies to IPv6 if it is used as either the tunneled or
    the tunneling protocol.

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST be able to mark or remark the Diffserv codepoint of traffic
      that will be placed over a tunnel, based on classification of that
      traffic (prior to placing it on the tunnel) using any of the classifiers
      supported by the RG. This only applies when the traffic is going from
      LAN to WAN.

    2: |
      The RG MUST be able to mark the Diffserv codepoint of the underlying
      tunnel or the IEEE 802.1Q Ethernet priority of Ethernet that is
      transporting the tunnel, based on classification of the tunneled traffic
      using any of the classifiers supported by the RG. This only applies when
      the traffic is going from LAN to WAN.

    3: |
      When the RG receives tunneled traffic from the WAN, it MUST be able to
      mark or remark the Diffserv codepoint of that traffic, based on
      classification of the tunneled traffic using any of the IP-layer or
      higher layer classifiers supported by the RG.

    4: |
      When the RG receives tunneled traffic from the WAN, it MUST be able to
      mark the IEEE 802.1Q Ethernet priority of the LAN Ethernet frame, based
      on classification of the tunneled traffic using any of the IP-layer or
      higher layer classifiers supported by the RG.

    5: |
      When the RG receives tunneled traffic from the WAN, it MUST be able to
      mark or remark the Diffserv codepoint or mark the IEEE 802.1Q Ethernet
      priority of the LAN Ethernet frame, based on classification of the WAN
      Ethernet, using any of the Ethernet-layer classifiers supported by the
      RG.

    6: |
      When the RG receives tunneled traffic from the WAN, it SHOULD be able to
      mark or remark the Diffserv codepoint or mark the IEEE 802.1Q Ethernet
      priority of the LAN Ethernet frame, based on classification of the
      underlying tunnel, using any of the IP-layer classifiers supported by
      the RG.
