    Connection Forwarding

  description: |
    The IPv6 parts of this module apply only if the RG has an IPv6 stack.

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST be able to route IP (v4 or v6) over Ethernet to LAN CPE.

    2: |
      PPPoE forwarding and associated operation in the RG MUST NOT fail nor
      operate improperly in the presence of vendor-specific PPPoE extensions
      that may be in use by LAN devices (i.e. the RG MUST interoperate with
      well known PPPoE client software).

    3: |
      The RG MUST support a minimum of eight LAN device-initiated PPPoE
      sessions from each LAN device being forwarded to a logical WAN
      connection.

    4: |
      The RG MUST be able to forward up to eight PPPoE sessions per logical
      WAN interface (PVC, RFC 2684 [@RFC2684] connection, VLAN, etc.).

    5: |
      The RG MUST be able to forward PPPoE sessions at all times when
      encapsulating Ethernet over AAL5. This applies when the RG has set up
      zero or more PPPoE sessions and/or when the RG is also running IP over
      Ethernet. The default setting MUST be for this pass-through to be on.

    6: |
      The RG MUST support manually setting (via the Web GUI and TR-064i2
      interfaces) an MTU to be used in negotiating MTU, overriding the default
      MTU. This applies to MTU negotiated in IPv4 or IPv6.

    7: |
      The RG MUST support path MTU discovery as defined in IETF RFC 1191 [@RFC1191] so
      that a LAN device can be told what to set its MTU to for IPv4 traffic.

    8: |
      The RG MUST support accepting IP (v4 and v6) forwarding/routing
      information from a Controller.

    9: |
      The RG MUST maintain route table entries for all connections it
      maintains on the WAN (e.g. per PVC, IP (v4 and v6) and PPP sessions) and
      for all LAN networks (including subnets).

    10: |
      The RG MUST allow for the selection of which traffic to forward over
      which connection (in the case of multiple PVCs, multiple PPPoE sessions,
      GPON Port ID, etc...) according to any one or more of the following
      pieces of information:

      (1) destination IP (v4 or v6) address(es) with subnet mask,

      (2) originating IP (v4 or v6) address(es) with subnet mask,

      (3) source MAC address,

      (4) destination MAC address,

      (5) protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, ...)

      (6) source port,

      (7) destination port,

      (8) IEEE 802.1Q user priority,

      (9) FQDN (fully qualified domain name) of WAN session,

      (10) DiffServ codepoint ([@RFC3260]),

      (11) Ethertype (IEEE 802.3 length/type field), and

      (12) traffic handled by an ALG.

    11: |
      The RG MUST allow for the selection of which traffic to forward over
      which connection (in the case of multiple PVCs, multiple PPPoE sessions,
      etc.) according to any one or more of the following pieces of
      information:

      (1) IEEE 802.1Q VLAN identification, and

      (2) packet length (Note: to be used judiciously to avoid out of order
      packet delivery).

    12: |
      The RG MUST NOT bridge or route between WAN connections (i.e. WAN to
      WAN) except when explicitly configured to do so.

    13: |
      The RG MUST NOT forward UPnP traffic (including UPnP multicast messages)
      to the WAN interface. This applies to both bridged and routed style
      configurations. This satisfies TR-101 R-235.

    14: |
      The RG SHOULD be able to restrict the routing information for each WAN
      connection to specific LAN devices.

      For example, a user might have four PCs in the home, have a WAN
      connection to the Internet and have a WAN connection to an employer's
      network. The RG could be configured to allow all PCs access to the
      Internet, but only one specific PC might be allowed to send traffic over
      the WAN interface to the employer's network.

    15: |
      The RG MUST support the possibility that all LAN devices concurrently
      access one or more WAN connections.

    16: |
      The RG SHOULD support the ability to accept IPv4 routes dynamically
      pushed from the WAN. This allows it to set up routing tables to support
      routing traffic over multiple connections (PVCs, PPPoE sessions, etc.).
      In particular, the RG SHOULD be configurable to accept RIP version 2
      (RIP-2) messages as defined in RFC 2453 [@RFC2453] to fulfill this task.

    17: |
      If RIP-2 is supported, it SHOULD be software configurable.

    18: |
      If RIP-2 is supported, by default, the RG MUST NOT transmit RIP-2
      information to WAN connections.

    19: |
      If RIP-2 is supported, the RG MUST be configurable to accept triggered
      RIP messages, as defined in RFC 2091 [@RFC2091].

    20: |
      The RG MUST be able to bridge IPv4 or route IPv4 or IPv6 over an
      Ethernet session concurrently with at least one RG-originated PPPoE
      session on each PVC that is running bridged Ethernet over the AAL.

    21: |
      The RG SHOULD be capable of initiating at least two PPPoE sessions per
      PVC and forwarding the IP (v4 or v6) traffic above PPPoE to the LAN CPE.
