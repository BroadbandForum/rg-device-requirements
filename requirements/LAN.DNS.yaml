    Naming Services (IPv4 and general requirements)

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST be capable of acting as a DNS server to LAN devices, passing
      its address as the DNS server back to these devices in DHCPv4 requests.

    2: |
      The RG SHOULD allow the user to specify that either network-learned or
      user-specified addresses be passed back to LAN devices as the DNS
      server(s) in DHCPv4 responses, instead of the RG's address.

    3: |
      When the RG learns DNS name server addresses from multiple WAN
      connections, the RG MUST follow specified DNS selection policy (if one
      is configured) to make recursive queries to DNS name servers, or (if
      there is no DNS selection policy) MUST query a server on each connection
      simultaneously and provide the requesting LAN client with the first
      returned positive result from these DNS servers. A negative response
      will not be transmitted to a LAN device until all WAN DNS servers have
      either timed out or returned a negative response to a common query.

      Service providers may choose not to provide DNS name server addresses on
      certain connections in a multiple connection configuration.

    4: |
      The RG MUST add the DNS entry "dsldevice" for its own address.

    5: |
      The RG MAY support additional DNS entries, as there could be additional
      types of CPE.

    6: |
      The RG MUST maintain local DNS entries for a minimum of 253 local LAN
      devices. This information can be obtained through auto discovery
      (e.g. from DHCPv4 requests, such as Client Identifier, and other
      protocol information). When unknown, the entry MUST be of the form
      "unknownxxxxxxxxxxxx" where "x" represents the MAC address of the
      associated LAN device.

    7: |
      The RG SHOULD provide a manual mechanism for overriding the learned
      names of all LAN CPE except that of the RG itself.

    8: |
      If the RG's DNS server is implemented as a forwarding proxy, it MUST be
      done according to the recommendations in RFC 5625 [@RFC5625].
