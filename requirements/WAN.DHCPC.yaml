    DHCP Client (DHCPv4)

  categories:

    - !include WAN.DHCPC.BFDecho.yaml
    - !include WAN.DHCPC.BFDKA.yaml

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST be able to obtain IPv4 network information dynamically on
      its WAN interface. This information includes IPv4 address, primary and
      secondary DNS addresses and default gateway address.

      Dynamically obtaining IPv4 network information is accomplished using
      DHCP (v4) and / or IPCP (IPv4).

    2: |
      If the RG is not configured to use a static IPv4 address and the RG
      fails to detect a PPPoE or DHCPv4 server, then the RG MUST set its WAN
      IPv4 address to an undefined value, in order to prevent it from
      retaining its prior IPv4 address.

    3: |
      If a RG is functioning as a DHCPv4 client, it MUST identify itself in
      option 61 (client-identifier) in every DHCPv4 message in accordance with
      RFC 4361 [@RFC4361].

    4: |
      For the DUID portion of option 61 in DHCPv4 as described in RFC 4361 [@RFC4361]
      , the RG MUST follow the DUID-EN format specified in ID 9.3 of RFC 3315 [@RFC3315].
      The RG MUST use Broadband Forum enterprise-number value 3561 in
      the DUID-EN enterprise-number field.

      For the identifier field of the DUID-EN, the RG MUST use an ASCII string
      containing the same content and formatted according to the same rules as
      defined for the HTTP username in ID 3.4.4 of TR-069 [@TR-069], if CWMP is used for
      remote management.

    5: |
      The RG IAID value in DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 MUST be a 32 bit number encoded
      in network byte order. In cases where the RG is functioning with a
      single DHCP client identity, it MUST use value 1 for IAID for all DHCP
      interactions. IAID is defined in RFC 3315 [@RFC3315].

      In cases where the RG is functioning with multiple DHCP client
      identities, the values of IAID have to start at 1 for the first identity
      and be incremented for each subsequent identity. The RG's mapping of
      IAID to its physical aspects or logical configuration SHOULD be as
      non-volatile as possible. For example, the RG MAY use IAID value 1 for
      the first physical interface and value 2 for the second. Alternatively,
      the RG MAY use IAID value 1 for the virtual circuit corresponding to the
      first connection object in the data model and value 2 for the second
      connection object in the data model.

    6: |
      The DUID-EN field value MAY be printed on the RG label.

    7: |
      A RG functioning as a DHCPv4 client MUST identify its manufacturer OUI,
      product class, model name and serial number using vendor-specific
      options as defined in RFC 3925 [@RFC3925]. Specifically, it MUST use
      option 125.

      Note that with exception of ModelName, the data contained in this option
      will be redundant with what is included in the Device ID in option 61.
      However, this is desirable because these two options serve different
      purposes.

      The data in option 125 allows the DHCPv4 server to be pre-configured
      with policy for handling classes of devices in a certain way without
      requiring the DHCPv4 server to be able to parse the unique format used
      in client-identifier option (which can also vary in TR-181 depending on
      presence of a ProductClass value). On the other hand, the
      client-identifier serves as an opaque but predictable identifier. It is
      predictable because it is the same identifier as used by the RG for
      interactions with other services. The same identifier is used for HTTP
      authentication and in SSL client certificates.

      Each sub-option value to be provided in option 125 MUST be treated as a
      string encoded into binary using UTF-8. The data MUST be encapsulated in
      option 125 under enterprise code 3561 decimal (0x0DE9), corresponding to
      the IANA "ADSL Forum" entry in the Private Enterprise Numbers registry.
      A specific sub-option is defined for each value. The value must match
      the corresponding TR-181 [@TR-181] parameter
      as defined in the following table:

      | Sub-option | Value Description | Corresponding Device:2 parameter |
      |------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
      | 1 | Manufacturer OUI | .DeviceInfo.ManufacturerOUI |
      | 2 | Product Class | .DeviceInfo.ProductClass |
      | 3 | Model Name | .DeviceInfo.ModelName |
      | 4 | Serial Number | .DeviceInfo.SerialNumber |

      If the value of a parameter is empty, the sub-option MUST be omitted.
    
    8: |
      The RG MUST be able to request DHCPv4 option 42 for NTP server information as per RFC 2132 [@RFC2132].

    9: |
      To obtain the local time zone, the RG SHOULD be able to request one of the following
      DHCPv4 options: Option 100 (PCode) or Option 101 (TCode) in accordance with RFC 4833 [@RFC4833].
