    2: |
      The RG MUST have a WANIPConnection:2 service when supporting a WAN IP
      Connection. The specification is available for download at

    4: |
      When supporting a WAN PPP Connection, the RG MUST support internal and
      external port values being different (the RG MUST NOT return

      When supporting a WAN PPP Connection, the RG MUST support specific IP
      address for RemoteHost (the RG MUST NOT return
      RemoteHostOnlySupportsWildcard on AddPortMapping).

    7: |
      When supporting a WAN PPP Connection, the RG MUST support specific port
