RGSMART.OPLAT:
  name: |
    Open platform Support

  description: |
    *Note*: *With the evolution of home networks, The Smart RG needs to
    support more and more third-party applications. Each Smart RG vendor has
    different hardware and software operating environments. An open platform
    allows to update the Smart RG with standardized additional software
    applications, without the need to maintain different versions.*

  categories:
    - !include RGSMART.OPLAT.OSGI.yaml
    - !include RGSMART.OPLAT.EE.yaml

  requirements:
    1: |
      The Smart RG MUST provide a generic open platform, which allows to
      execute modular Software Applications in a virtual environment.

    2: |
      The open platform MUST provide APIs, which allow software applications
      to interact with the smart gateway for requesting/configuring access
      services, data flow services, common services (e.g. query device
      information).

    3: |
      The open platform MUST provide APIs, which allow software applications
      to interact with the home network and services in the home network (LAN
      addressing services).

    4: |
      The open platform MUST provide APIs, which allow software applications
      to access the uplink and interact with cloud services.

    5: |
      The open platform MUST provide a mechanism, to authenticate software
      modules and applications and restrict the execution to certified
      software applications.

    6: |
      The Smart RG open platform MUST support software module management to
      load and unload software modules.

    7: |
      The Smart RG open platform MUST support software module management to
      start and stop software applications.

    8: |
      All installed software modules MUST be persistent during upgrades of the
      Smart RG, or a mechanism MUST be provided which reinstalls the previous
      installed software modules.

    9: |
      If TR-069 is used the open platform SHOULD support the functions in
      TR-069a6, Appendix VI "Software Module Management" to manage and control
      the software applications and software modules.

    10: |
      If USP is used the open platform SHOULD support the functions in TR-369,
      Appendix I "Software Module Management" to manage and control the
      software applications and software modules.

    11: |
      The open platform SHOULD support to limit the resources used by open
      platform environments and applications including CPU time, number of
      threads, RAM, and Sockets used.
