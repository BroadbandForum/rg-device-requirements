    Local Management

    - !include MGMT.LOCAL.TR-064.yaml

  requirements:
    1: |
      If the RG is in a bridged configuration the RG MUST be able to disable
      all LAN side configuration mechanisms (i.e.Â the Web GUI, Broadband Forum
      TR-064i2 [@TR-064i2], etc.).

    2: |
      The RG MUST support a configuration mechanism from the PC as defined in
      Broadband Forum TR-064i2 [@TR-064i2].

    3: |
      This requirement has been obsoleted.

    4: |
      The RG MUST be configurable via embedded, easy-to-use Web GUI pages.

    5: |
      Broadband Forum TR-064i2 [@TR-064i2] and Web GUI authorization MUST time out after 30 minutes of
      disuse.

    6: |
      The Web GUI pages MUST be available when the RG is in bridged mode.

    7: |
      The RG MUST NOT require browser support of Java, ActiveX nor VBSCRIPT in
      its web pages.

    8: |
      The Web GUI pages SHOULD minimize internal page complexity
      (e.g. excessive use of frames, pop-ups, style sheets, JavaScript, etc.)
      that places demands on browser resources or causes interoperability
      problems with different browsers. In general, all pages SHOULD load
      within five seconds.

    9: |
      The web interface MUST be OS independent and browser independent
      (e.g. must work with versions of Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome,
      Safari and Opera that were released within the past five years).

    10: |
      The RG MUST have a software mechanism by which the user can reset it to
      default factory settings.

    11: |
      The RG MUST support an RG access code (i.e. password) that protects it
      from being updated (firmware, configuration, operational state, etc.)
      from the local LAN.

    12: |
      If a default RG access code has been set, the default RG access code
      MUST be on the bottom of the RG.

    13: |
      If a default RG access code has been set, the RG MUST force the user to
      accept the default RG access code or install a new RG access code prior
      to allowing any initial configuration (e.g. during initial installation
      or after an RG reset to factory defaults).

    14: |
      The user MUST be able to disable the use of the RG access code. The user
      MUST be warned in the Web GUI of the implications of undertaking this
      action.

    15: |
      The RG MUST support updating of its firmware via the Web GUI and
      Broadband Forum TR-064i2 [@TR-064i2] interfaces.

    16: |
      The RG MUST use standard protocols when using FTP, HTTP and HTTPS as
      defined in IETF RFCs 959, 2616, 5246, and 2818.

    17: |
      The RG MUST support restarting the broadband connection (all layers) via
      the Web GUI and Broadband Forum TR-064i2 [@TR-064i2] interfaces.

    18: |
      The RG SHOULD be able to copy log files to a PC on the local LAN or
      network server in ASCII text format, using the Web GUI and Broadband Forum TR-064i2 [@TR-064i2]
      interfaces.

    19: |
      The RG MUST have a quick start page in the Web GUI allowing for rapid
      configuration in a minimum number of steps (e.g. on a single page).
      Default values for PPPoE and PVC can be used to facilitate this.

    20: |
      The model and firmware/software versions MUST be easily identifiable via
      the Web GUI interface.

    21: |
      The Web GUI interface MUST allow the user to browse and select an update
      file from a local PC and use HTTP to update the RG using this file (see
      IETF RFCs 1867, 2388 and HTML 4.1 specifications for more details).

    22: |
      If the RG has been configured to do so, the Web GUI MUST allow the user
      to specify that firmware be updated from a predefined web location. The
      RG MUST allow the web location to be specified via the Web GUI and
      Broadband Forum TR-064i2 [@TR-064i2] interfaces.

    23: |
      The web location MAY be predefined by the RG manufacturer. This value is
      overridden by the mechanisms and information identified in requirement
      MGMT.LOCAL.21.

    24: |
      If the RG has been configured to allow updating from a predefined web
      location, the RG MUST display an update button in the Web GUI. The user
      can then select the update button to initiate an update using a file
      retrieved via ftp or http as identified in the associated URL (2 URLs
      may be hard coded; the second URL will be used if file retrieval is not
      possible from the first URL).

    25: |
      If the RG has been configured to allow updating from a predefined web
      location, the mechanism used to identify the availability of an update,
      the description of the update and the actual update SHOULD operate
      solely based on the presence (or absence) of named files returned in a
      directory list using the web location URL.

      For example, an RG might retrieve the directory list, find the update
      associated with the RG by the presence of the following file:

      Vendor-model-v100210-n100215.pkg

      This would identify that for device "model" from "vendor" currently
      running version 10.02.10 there exists an update whose version is
      10.02.15. The text describing the update, if available, might be located
      in a file of the name:

      Vendor-model-v100210-n100215.txt

    26: |
      If the RG has been configured to do so, the Web GUI MUST display a web
      link to which the user may go to browse for update files and other
      update information. The RG MUST allow this URL to be specified and
      overridden by the Broadband Forum TR-064i2 [@TR-064i2] interfaces and from a Controller.

    27: |
      The web link MAY be set to a default value by the RG manufacturer.
