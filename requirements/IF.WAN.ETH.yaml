    Ethernet (WAN)

  requirements:
    1: |
      If the RG supports an optional WAN Ethernet port, it MUST support a
      100BASE-T or connecting a MDU in FTTB scenario a 100/1000BASE-T Ethernet
      port.

    2: |
      If the RG supports a WAN Ethernet port in addition to another physical
      WAN link type (e.g. ADSL, VDSL2, ONU function, etc.), simultaneous use
      of both WAN ports MUST NOT be supported.

    3: |
      The RG SHOULD be able to support 2.5GBase-T and 5GBase-T.

    4: |
      An automatic WAN port selection function MAY be supported as follows:

      Upon first boot-up or power cycle of the RG, the RG MUST wait until it
      is fully operational prior to attempting to selecting the source WAN
      port to use. The RG MUST first search for a DSL signal prior to
      selecting the Ethernet port as the WAN link. This is intended to avoid
      race conditions that happen because DSL typically requires a longer time
      to detect physical layer than Ethernet.

      If both Ethernet and DSL signals are detected simultaneously, the RG
      MUST by default select the DSL link as the WAN source port.

      Once the source of the physical signal has been detected on a valid
      source connector, it MUST be used persistently until power is removed
      from the RG or the selection is overridden via Web GUI or from a
      Controller. In other words, even if a connection is lost, the RG MUST
      NOT automatically switch to an alternate link source (e.g. DSL to
      Ethernet, or Ethernet to DSL). Automatic pair detection schemes are
      excluded from this requirement -- meaning that DSL line 1/2 auto
      selection, and Ethernet auto-MDIX/MDX MUST still operate properly to
      accommodate end-user faulty wiring. For example if DSL line 1 is
      detected first, and the customer disconnects DSL and reconnects to line
      2 instead, the RG should allow this type of switching and connect to DSL
      on line 2 and not by accident switch to a potentially present Ethernet
      signal instead.

    5: |
      The RG MUST support configuring the current default WAN port being used
      via Web GUI or from a Controller.

      This should result in the RG immediately switching to the selected port.

    6: |
      Any Ethernet port used as a WAN link SHOULD be non-blocking for LAN to
      LAN and LAN to WAN traffic flows.

      Blocking may occur in some implementations that utilize one port of a
      multi-port Ethernet switch for WAN use, sometimes as a result requiring
      LAN to LAN traffic to be forwarded and processed through the RG CPU.
