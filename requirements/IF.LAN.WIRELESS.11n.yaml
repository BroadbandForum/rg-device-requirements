IF.LAN.WIRELESS.11n:
  name: |
    Wireless: 802.11n Access Point

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST work in one of the following modes:

      * 2.4GHz,

      * 5GHz,

      * 2.4GHz or 5GHz selectable

      * 2.4GHz and 5GHz concurrently.

    2: |
      The RG MUST implement MIMO technology and support MCS index 15 or
      above.

      Note: MCS defines Modulation and Coding Schemes; MCS-15 supports two
      spatial streams in both directions. While using 40MHz wide channel and
      400ns guard interval, it can achieve 300Mbps through 64-QAM modulation.

    3: |
      The RG MUST support 802.11n 20/40MHz channel mode in the 5GHz frequency
      band.

    4: |
      The RG SHOULD support 802.11n 20/40MHz channel mode in the 2.4GHz
      frequency band.

      Note: WFA mandates not to configure 40MHz channel mode by default in the
      2.4GHz band

    5: |
      The RG MUST support an aggregated MAC service data unit (AMSDU)
      mechanism for Rx mode.

    6: |
      The RG MUST support an aggregated MAC protocol data unit (AMPDU)
      mechanism for Rx and Tx mode.

    7: |
      The RG MUST be able to adjust the size of A-MSDU and A-MPDU according to
      the quality of the channel.

    8: |
      The RG MUST support a short guard interval (GI) of 400ns.

    9: |
      The RG MUST support dynamic MIMO power saving mode.

    10: |
      The RG MAY support greenfield mode.
