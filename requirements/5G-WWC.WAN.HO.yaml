  name: |
    5G WWC Multi-access handover support

  description: |
    A device that is equipped with both a wireline and a radio interface
    (E-UTRA or NR) may implement resiliency on the basis of mobility
    hand-off. This can be in the wireline to wireless direction or vice
    versa.

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support mobility between the NG-RAN and W-5GAN based upon
      handover procedures triggered by the 5G-RG, and defined in clause 7.6 of
      3GPP TS 23.316 [@3GPP-TS.23.316] as well as in 3GPP TS 23.502 [@3GPP-TS.23.502] clause 4.9.2.2, for 3GPP
      to Non-3GPP transition for a single-access PDU session (where "UE" is
      replaced by "5G-RG" and "N3IWF" by "W-5GAN").

    2: |
      The RG MUST support mobility between E-UTRAN and W-5GAN based on
      handover procedures triggered by the 5G-RG as described in clause 7.6.4
      of 3GPP TS 23.316 [@3GPP-TS.23.316] and clause 4.11.3 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [@3GPP-TS.23.502] (where "UE"
      is replaced by "5G-RG" and "N3IWF" by "W-5GAN").
