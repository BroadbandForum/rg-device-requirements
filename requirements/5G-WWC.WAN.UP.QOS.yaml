5G-WWC.WAN.UP.QOS:
  name: |
    5G WWC WAN User Plane QoS

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support an "upstream QOS classifier table" maintained at the
      granularity of PDU session, that stores QOS rules and is used to perform
      filter matching on upstream traffic in order to associate specific flows
      with QFI.

    2: |
      The RG MUST support population of the "upstream QOS

      classifier table" by NAS.

    3: |
      The RG MUST support population of the "upstream QOS classifier table"
      (including initializing an age out timer to the RQ timeout value for the
      session) with UE derived QOS rules with the filter information gleaned
      from the IP header and 5WE encoded QFI for packets received that have
      the RQI bit set in the 5WE header

    4: |
      When the RG receives a packet with RQI set where there already is a UE
      derived QOS rule for the gleaned filter information in the "upstream QOS
      classifier table" it MUST update the age out timer value to the RQ
      timeout value for the session and the QFI value to that gleaned from the
      current packet's 5WE header.

    5: |
      When the RG forwards a packet upstream where it does not find a QOS rule
      filter match in the "upstream QOS classifier table", it MUST mark the
      packet according to the default QFI for the PDU session.

    6: |
      When the RG forwards a packet upstream where it does find a filter match
      in the upstream QOS classifier table", it MUST mark the packet according
      to the QFI associated with the QOS rule.

    7: |
      The RG MUST age out UE derived QOS rules populated as a result of
      downstream UP signaling (received RQI indication) upon expiry of the age
      out timer

    8: |
      The RG MUST remove all entries in the "upstream QOS classification
      table" associated with a PDU session at the time of session release.

    9: |
      The RG MUST use the QFI to DSCP/PCP mappings for the PDU session
      received in the AS session parameters information. If the information is
      not present, the RG will revert to local configuration.

      Note: That mapping is unique per session, and the same QFI value used in
      two separate sessions may have a different mapping per session.

    10: |
      When marking upstream packets according to the QFI to PCP/DSCP
      information received in the AS session parameters TLV, the RG MUST mark
      the Ethernet PCP according to the PCP information in the AS subscription
      parameters marking control sub-TLV:

      * Include the PCP in the tag control information of a tagged UNI

      Include the PCP information in a priority tag if the use of priority
      tagging is indicated via the P-bit being set in the marking controls or
      in local configuration, no marking for an untagged UNI if not indicated

    11: |
      When remarking upstream packets according to the QFI to PCP/DSCP
      information received in the AS session parameters TLV, the RG MUST
      remark the IP DSCP if upstream remarking is indicated in the
      subscription parameters marking control sub-TLV.
