      The RG MUST periodically collect Ethernet layer and channel performance
      data from HomePNA devices in the HomePNA network and report the data via

    6: |
      The RG MUST collect HomePNA network utilization information based on RG
      utilization and network idle time and report the data via Web GUI,
      Broadband Forum TR-064i2 [@TR-064i2] interfaces and from a Controller.

    7: |
      The RG MUST be able to collect performance monitoring data from at least
      10 HomePNA network devices in every HomePNA interface and report the
      data via Web GUI, Broadband Forum TR-064i2 [@TR-064i2] interfaces and from a Controller.

    8: |
      The RG MUST enable provisioning of the specific HomePNA devices from
      which performance monitoring data will be collected via Web GUI,
      Broadband Forum TR-064i2 [@TR-064i2] interfaces and from a Controller.

      Ethernet layer performance data MUST be associated with the individual
      device's information:

      * HomePNA MAC address

      * HomePNA station/node ID

      * Master/endpoint device indication

    10: |
      Channel performance monitoring data MUST include the following:

      * Channel host source and destination MAC addresses

      * Channel HomePNA source and destination MAC addresses

      * Channel HomePNA PHY rate

      * Channel estimated SNR

      * Number of packets sent in channel. This parameter MUST be
      synchronized at both transmitter and receiver ends.

      * Number of pre-LARQ packets received in channel. This parameter MUST
      be synchronized at both transmitter and receiver ends for network packet
      loss calculation purposes.

    11: |
      Channel performance monitoring data SHOULD include the following:

      * Number of post-LARQ packets received in channel. This parameter MUST
      be synchronized at both transmitter and receiver ends for network packet
      loss calculation purposes.

    12: |
      The RG MUST be able to configure and execute full or partial network
      diagnostics using HomePNA CERT protocol (defined in ITU-T G.9954 [@G.9954]) and MUST
      collect diagnostic results from all HomePNA devices under test. The RG
      MUST collect the following diagnostics results between any two nodes in
      the network and report them via Web GUI, Broadband Forum TR-064i2 [@TR-064i2] interfaces and from a
      Controller:

      * Baud and PHY rate

      * SNR

      * Number of received test packets

      * Line attenuation

    13: |
      The RG MUST be able to read the following configuration parameters from
      HomePNA devices in the HomePNA network. The device MAY optionally enable
      provisioning of all parameters or a subset of the configuration
      parameters to be read from local HPNA devices:

      * Noise margin

      * Desired PER

      * MAC address

      * Device master/endpoint mode

      * LARQ enabling

    14: |
      The RG MUST support at least one of the following spectral modes:

      * Spectral mode A: 4-20MHz -- twisted pair/coax

      * Spectral mode B: 12-28MHz -- twisted pair/coax

      * Spectral mode C: 36-52MHz -- coax only

      * Spectral mode D: 4-36MHz -- coax only

    15: |
      The RG MAY support more than one HomePNA network operating in different
      spectral modes on the same or different physical coax cables.

    16: |
      If xDSL and HomePNA coexist on the RG, the xDSL and HomePNA signals MUST
      NOT interfere with each other or affect performance in any valid
      spectrum band plan combinations described in the table below:

      | | **Band "A"** | **Band "B"** | **Band "C"** | **Band "D"** |
      |-|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|

      | VDSL2 8x | No / No | Yes / Yes | Yes | No |
      | VDSL2 | No / No | No / No | Yes | No |

    17: |
      The RG MUST NOT support both HomePNA and xDSL simultaneously on the same
      physical wire if the xDSL and HomePNA spectrum bands used are not
      indicated as valid in the HomePNA spectrum compatibility table above.

    18: |
      The RG MUST implement sufficient filtering and isolation so that HomePNA
      and xDSL interfaces will not interfere with each other's spectrum.

      The RG SHOULD support layer 2 guaranteed QoS on the HomePNA interface.

    22: |
      The RG SHOULD be able to reserve bandwidth (media access time) on the

      requirements for throughput (rate), latency and jitter.

      traffic specifications in the HomePNA device.

    24: |
