      placement into appropriate queues (or discard) based on any one or more
      of the following pieces of information:

      (1) packet length (note: to be used with caution to avoid re-ordering
      packets), and

      (v4 or v6) headers as defined in RFC 2474 [@RFC2474].

      packets marked with recommended Diffserv codepoints, whose values and
      behavior are defined in RFC 2474 [@RFC2474], RFC 2475 [@RFC2475],
      RFC 2597 [@RFC2597], RFC 3246 [@RFC3246], and RFC 3260 [@RFC3260].

      Specifically, the values shown in the DSCP column of the table below
      MUST be supported, except Cs0-7, which are optional.

      | Cs7 (optional) | Class Selector 7 | cs7 | 56 |

    5: |
      The RG MUST be able to mark or remark the Diffserv codepoint or IEEE
      802.1Q Ethernet priority of traffic identified based on any of the
      classifiers supported by the RG.

    6: |
      *Requirement relocated to WAN.QoS.VLAN.1*

    7: |
      *Requirement relocated to WAN.QoS.VLAN.2*

    8: |
      *Requirement relocated to WAN.QoS.VLAN.3*

    9: |
      The RG MUST support one best effort (BE) queue, one expedited forwarding
      (EF) queue and a minimum of four assured forwarding (AF) queues.

    10: |
      The RG MUST duplicate the set of queues for each access session (e.g. L2
      PVC, VLAN). This can be done logically or physically.

    11: |
      The RG SHOULD support the appropriate mechanism to effectively implement
      Diffserv per-hop scheduling behaviors. The RG SHOULD be able to
      configure each queue defined in WAN.QoS.9 for strict priority or
      weighted round robin scheduling.

      SP queues are served with priority over all other queues. A strict
      priority scheduler is preferred for EF.

      WRR queues are served on the basis of configurable weights, provided
      with a mechanism to prevent starvation (WRR queue minimum bandwidth)

    12: |
      The RG MUST support aggregate shaping of upstream traffic across all
      access sessions (e.g. L2 PVC, VLAN).

    13: |
      The RG MUST support per-class shaping of upstream traffic.

      Classes are defined in WAN.QoS.4.

    14: |
      The RG MUST support the capability to fragment IP traffic on sessions
      that it originates, in order to limit the effect of large packets on
      traffic delay.

    15: |
      The packet size threshold before fragmenting AF and BE packets MUST be
      configurable.

    16: |
      The RG MUST handle all telephone service-related network traffic by a
      high priority queue to avoid congestion, delay, jitter, or packet loss.

    17: |
      The RG MAY handle all telephone service-related network traffic by a
      dedicated WAN interface to avoid congestion, delay, jitter, or packet
      loss.

    18: |
      The RG MUST provide counters in terms of dropped and emitted
      packets/bytes for each queue. Statistics SHOULD be collected from the
      time of last counter reset or on a configurable sample interval.

    19: |
      The RG MUST provide information about queue occupancy in terms of
      packets and peak percentage. Statistics SHOULD be collected from the
      time of last counter reset or on a configurable sample interval.

    20: |
      The RG MUST support classification of WAN-directed internally-generated
      traffic and placement into appropriate queues based on any one or more
      of the following pieces of information:

      (1) destination IP address(es) with subnet mask,

      (2) originating IP address(es) with subnet mask,

      (3) protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, ...),

      (4) source TCP/UDP port and port range,

      (5) destination TCP/UDP port and port range,

      (6) Diffserv codepoint ([@RFC3260]),

      (7) physical port, in case of voice packets.

    21: |
      The RG SHOULD support classification of WAN directed internally
      generated traffic and placement into appropriate queues based on any one
      or more of the following pieces of information:

      (1) packet length.

    22: |
      The RG MUST be able to learn classification keys (MAC address and IP
      address) through the following option of the DHCP client requests on the
      LAN that it serves:

      (1) DHCP Option 60 (Vendor Class ID),

      (2) DHCP Option 61 (Client Identifier),

      (3) DHCP Option 77 (User Class ID), and

      (4) DHCP Option 125 (Vendor Specific Information).

    23: |
      The RG SHOULD be able to learn classification keys (MAC address and IP
      address) for trusted DLNA devices as they are recognized on the LAN.
