IF.LAN.MoCA:
  name: |
    MoCA (LAN)

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support a MoCA LAN interface compliant with the MoCA
      Alliance specification. Information regarding the specification is
      available only to members of the MoCA Alliance, further details can be
      obtained from the consortium at http://www.mocalliance.org.

    2: |
      The RG MUST present the MoCA LAN link on an F-connector type coaxial
      connector.

    3: |
      The RG MUST provide a facility to enable or disable the MoCA LAN port
      via the Web GUI, Broadband Forum TR-064i2 [@TR-064i2] interfaces and from a Controller.

    4: |
      The MoCA LAN port MUST support PER (Packet Error Rate) less than 1E-6 on
      the MoCA link. Note that PER is the measurement of link layer error. Any
      additional PER caused by the dropping of packets as a result of the RG
      saturating the MoCA link is not included in the link layer PER specified
      in this requirement.

    5: |
      The MoCA LAN port MUST support the following configurable parameters:

      * Channel

      * Privacy

      * Security key password (used to generate security keys for the MoCA
      link).

      * Manual or auto-selection of Network Coordinator through interfaces
      such a Web GUI.

    6: |
      The RG default security key password MUST comply with the MoCA
      specification.

    7: |
      The RG MAY support configuring a custom security key password to meet
      service provider requirements.

    8: |
      If the MoCA LAN port can operate on more than one channel the RG MUST
      support manual channel selection in the Web GUI or from a Controller.
      The frequency range for MoCA LAN port spans from 850MHz to 1.5GHz and
      each MoCA LAN channel covers a 50MHz band.

    9: |
      The power control function of a MoCA LAN port MUST comply with the
      following requirements:

      * The adjustable range of output power MUST be at least 25db

      * The target PHY rate is the maximum rate that a MoCA link should
      support.

      * If the measured PHY rate is less than the Target PHY rate, it MUST be
      within 30Mbps of the target PHY rate unless the output power is already
      at maximum.

      * The measured PHY rate MAY be greater than the target PHY rate.

    10: |
      The MoCA LAN network MUST support the following sustained aggregate MAC
      throughput with PER \< 1E-6 with 50db attenuation (measured aggregate
      MAC throughput is based on 1500 byte packets and independent of the
      traffic pattern):

      * 125Mbps with 2 MoCA devices in the network

      * 117.5Mbps with 3 MoCA devices in the network

      * 110.5Mbps with 4 MoCA devices in the network

      * 103.8Mbps with 5 MoCA devices in the network

      * 98Mbps with 6 and above MoCA devices in the network.

    11: |
      The device to device ping reply time (round trip) across two MoCA
      devices on the same RF channel MUST be within 7ms on average and 10ms
      maximum.

    12: |
      The RG MUST reach optimal MoCA link layer capacity within 5 minutes
      after power up.

    13: |
      The RG SHOULD reach optimal MoCA link layer capacity within 3 minutes
      after power up.

    14: |
      The RG MUST support sending/receiving packet to/from at least 64 MAC
      addresses on the MoCA interface.

    15: |
      The RG MUST support MoCA interface statistics collection, parameter
      provisioning, and diagnostic results display via the Web GUI, Broadband Forum TR-064i2 [@TR-064i2]
      interfaces and from a Controller.

    16: |
      The RG SHOULD be able to reserve bandwidth (media access time) on the
      network for services requesting QoS guarantees so as to meet QoS
      requirements for throughput (rate), latency and jitter.
