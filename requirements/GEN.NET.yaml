    Networking Protocols

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support Ethernet (IEEE 802.3).

    2: |
      The RG MUST support IP Version 4.

    3: |
      If the RG does not support IPV6, it SHOULD be software configurable or
      upgradeable to support IP Version 6 in the future. This means that the
      processing power, memory and networking components be designed
      appropriately and be sufficiently robust to provide this support.

    4: |
      The RG MUST support the TCP, IP, UDP, routing and associated IETF protocols
      identified here:

      * RFC 768 [@RFC768] User Datagram Protocol

      * RFC 791 [@RFC791] Internet Protocol

      * RFC 792 [@RFC792] Internet Control Message Protocol

      * RFC 793 [@RFC793] Transmission Control Protocol

      * RFC 826 [@RFC826] Ethernet Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

    5: |
      The RG MUST support IP over Ethernet.

    6: |
      The RG MUST support, at a minimum, a 256 MAC address table for LAN
      devices.
