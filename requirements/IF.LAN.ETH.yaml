IF.LAN.ETH:
  name: |
    Ethernet (LAN)

  categories:
    - !include IF.LAN.ETH.SWITCH.yaml

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support use of a straight-through (patch) cable between the
      Ethernet interface and a PC.

    2: |
      The RG SHOULD automatically sense the transmit and receive pair on the
      Ethernet physical connection.

    3: |
      The RG MUST have at least one 10/100BASE-T Ethernet port (RJ-45 jack)
      for connecting it to the home data network. A 1000BASE-T port is
      recommended.

    4: |
      The RG MUST be able to support both 100BASE-T and 1000BASE-T with auto
      negotiate for speed and duplex on a port-by-port basis according to
      IEEE 802.3 [@802.3-2012].

    5: |
      The Ethernet LAN interface SHOULD allow for adjusting the inter-frame
      and collision back off timers so that traffic marked with Ethernet
      priority (as defined in IEEE 802.1Q) can get statistically better
      treatment on broadcast LAN segments.
