    Port Forwarding (IPv4)

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support port forwarding. That is, the RG MUST be able to be
      configured to direct traffic based on any combination of source IPv4
      address, source protocol (TCP or UDP) and port (or port range) to a
      particular LAN device and port (or port range on that device).

      Individual port forwarding rules MUST be associated with a LAN device,
      not the IPv4 address of the LAN device, and follow the LAN device should
      its IPv4 address change.

    2: |
      The port forwarding mechanism MUST be able to be configured to direct
      all inbound unidentified or unsolicited port traffic originating from a
      user-selected public IPv4 address to any user selected LAN device.

      The LAN device may be using either a private IPv4 address or the public
      WAN IPv4 address as identified in requirement LAN.ADDRESS.6 and
      LAN.ADDRESS.7.

    3: |
      The port forwarding mechanism of the RG SHOULD be easy to configure for
      common applications and user protocols (e.g. ftp, http, etc.) by
      specifying a protocol name or application name in a "Common Applications
      Names List" instead of a port number and protocol type. A partial list
      of applications for potential inclusion appears in Appendix I.

    4: |
      The "Common Applications Names List" mechanism MUST be integrated with
      the port forwarding mechanism.

    5: |
      The RG MUST include port forwarding configurations and "Common
      Applications Name Listings" for the following applications and protocols
      that do not function properly with NAT or NAPT: FTP client, H.323, SIP,
      IPsec, PPTP, MSN Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger, Yahoo Messenger and
      ICQ.

    6: |
      The RG SHOULD include port forwarding configurations and "Common
      Applications Name Listings" for other major applications and protocols
      that do not function properly with NAT or NAPT.
