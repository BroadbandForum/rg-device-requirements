    6rd Transition Mechanism

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support the 6rd transition mechanism as described in
      RFC 5969 [@RFC5969]. This includes being able to
      configure the necessary parameters from the Controller and via DHCPv4,
      creation of the prefix, using the created prefix as a "delegated prefix"
      for purpose of including one of its /64s in RA messages, and modifying
      the IP header for traffic that goes between the WAN and LAN devices.

    2: |
      The RG MUST support enabling and disabling of the 6rd feature on the
      "default" routed IPv4 connection. 6rd is not applicable to bridged WAN
      interfaces.

    3: |
      If the RG supports configuration mechanisms other than the 6rd DHCPv4
      option 212 (user-entered, Controller configured, etc.), the RG MUST
      support 6rd in "hub and spoke" mode. 6rd in "hub and spoke" mode
      requires all IPv6 traffic to go to the 6rd border relay. In effect, this
      requirement removes the "direct connect to 6rd" route defined in section
      7.1.1 of RFC 5969 [@RFC5969].
