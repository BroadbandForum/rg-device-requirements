    PPP Client

  categories:

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support PPP and the associated protocols as defined in IETF
      RFCs 1332, 1334, 1661, 1877, 1994.

    2: |
      Upon receipt of non-standard or unrecognized PPP extensions according to
      IETF RFCs 1570 and 2153 from the broadband network (e.g. vendor or
      proprietary), the RG MUST operate without fault.

    3: |
      The RG MUST support PPPoE as defined in RFC 2516 [@RFC2516].

    4: |
      The RG MUST support RFC 4638 [@RFC4638] in order to accommodate MTU/MRU values
      greater than 1492 bytes in PPPoE.

    5: |
      If the RG supports ATM, the RG SHOULD support PPP over AAL5 (PPPoA) as
      defined in RFC 2364 [@RFC2364].

    6: |
      The RG MUST be able to save all logins and passwords for PPP sessions
      originated by the RG. Passwords MUST NOT be available outside the RG
      (that is, they cannot be queried or displayed).

    7: |
      The RG MUST NOT immediately terminate PPPoE sessions and upper layer
      protocol connections when the physical connection is lost. It should
      defer the teardown process for two minutes. If the physical connection
      is restored during that time, the RG MUST first attempt to use its
      previous PPPoE session settings. If these are rejected, then the
      original PPPoE session is to be terminated and a new PPPoE session
      attempted.

    8: |
      The RG SHOULD incorporate a random timing delay prior to starting each
      IP (v4 or v6) and PPP session. This random timing delay helps to reduce
      connection failures when a group of users attempts to establish
      connections to a service provider at the same time (e.g. after power is
      restored to a neighborhood that had a blackout).

    9: |
      If the RG receives an authentication failure when attempting an
      automated PPP connection attempt, it SHOULD re-try immediately to
      establish the connection. After three unsuccessful attempts, the RG
      SHOULD wait for five minutes, then repeat the connection attempt three
      times. If authentication still fails, the RG SHOULD back off to thirty
      minute intervals between groups of three attempts.

    10: |
      If the RG is using the PPPoE client function actively, the RG MUST be
      able to forward PPPoE sessions initiated from LAN devices as additional
      PPPoE sessions to the WAN interface (this is sometimes known as PPPoE
      pass-through). Specifically, these LAN initiated PPPoE sessions MUST NOT
      be tunneled inside the RG's primary PPPoE client session.

    11: |
      When fragmentation is required, the RG MUST fragment all PPP sessions
      that it originates on an access VC using MLPPP interleaving as defined
      in RFC 1990 [@RFC1990].

    12: |
      If PPP is used, the RG MAY obtain an IPv4 subnet mask on its WAN
      interface using IPCP (IPv4) extensions. If this is done, the IPv4 subnet
      masks will be communicated with IPCP (IPv4) using the PPP IPCP (IPv4)
      option with option code 144, the length of the option being 6 and the
      mask being expressed as a 32-bit mask (e.g. 0xFFFFFF80), not as a number
      indicating the consecutive number of 1s in the mask (from 0 to 32).

      The learned network information MAY, but need not, be used to populate
      the LAN side embedded DHCP server for the RG.

      The learned network information is treated as a subnet and not as a
      collection of individual addresses. That is, the first and last
      addresses in the subnet should not be used.

      The IPv4 address negotiated SHOULD, but need not, be the one assigned to
      the RG.

    13: |
      The RG MUST make the access concentrator name used with PPPoE
      connections available via the Web GUI, TR-064i2, and for a Controller
      for diagnostic purposes.

    14: |
      The RG MUST support RFC 3544 [@RFC3544], "*IP Header Compression over PPP*".
