    BFD Keep-alive

  requirements:
    1: |
      RG MUST support the BFD protocol for IP Session Keep-alive. The BFD
      implementation MUST be compliant with the BFD standard as described in
      the RFC 5880 [@RFC5880] .

    2: |
      BFD MUST be initiated after both the RG and the IP Edge's IP addresses
      are available on the RG.

    3: |
      The RG MUST take on the Passive role during BFD session initiation.

    4: |
      The RG MUST support BFD Demand mode

    5: |
      The RG MUST support BFD Asynchronous mode.

    6: |
      The RG MUST be able to process BFD echo packets in the data plane as
      specified in RFC 5881 [@RFC5881].

    7: |
      The RG MUST be able to configure the DSCP bits of BFD packets.

    8: |
      The RG MUST be able to configure the Ethernet Priority bits of BFD
      packets.

    9: |
      The RG SHOULD respond to IP Edge initiated BFD polls using the same DSCP
      and Ethernet Priority values received in the packet

    10: |
      The RG MUST ignore IP packets arriving on the BFD UDP port other than
      those originating on the IP Edge.

    11: |
      The BFD configuration on the RG MUST be configurable using Broadband Forum TR-069 [@TR-069].

    12: |
      When using BFD Demand mode, the RG MUST run an inactivity timer based on
      the Detect Interval negotiated with the IP Edge.

    13: |
      When a BFD session on the RG receives a poll with a Diag code set to
      "Path Down" it MUST perform the following actions:

      * Transition into the Down state;

      * Respond to the poll with the Diag code set to 3 ("Neighbor Signaled
      BFD Session Down")

      * Prompt the DHCP client to transition into the Init-Reboot state for
      DHCPv4 initiated IP Sessions.

      * Prompt the DHCP client to send a CONFIRM message for DHCPv6 initiated
      IP Sessions.

    14: |
      The RG DHCP client MUST be able to enter DHCPv4 Init-Reboot state or
      DHCPv6 Confirm state upon detecting that BFD has transitioned into
      "Down" state.

    15: |
      The RG MUST use the IP Edge address as the destination for BFD Control
      packets.

    16: |
      The RG MUST be able to be pre-provisioned with the following Broadband
      Forum specified default configuration:

      * Version (1)

      * Control Plane Independent (0)

      * Authentication Present (0)

      * Demand (1)

      * Detect Multiplier (3)

      * Local Discriminator (a random 32-bit value)

      * Desired Minimum Transmit Interval (1,000,000)

      * Required Minimum Receive Interval (1,000,000)

      * Required Minimum Echo Receive Interval (0)

      * State (Down)
