    802.1X Client

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support IEEE 802.1X acting as a supplicant.

    2: |
      The RG MUST be able to respond to an appropriate IEEE 802.1X request and
      provide certificate information using Extensible Authentication
      Protocol-Transport Layer Security (EAP/TLS).

    3: |
      The RG SHOULD support EAP-MD5 username and password type authentication.

    4: |
      The RG MUST support receiving IEEE 802.1X EAPOL frames with an
      individual MAC address (i.e. unicast) as well as frames with a group MAC
      address (i.e. multicast).

    5: |
      The RG MUST perform mutual authentication by authenticating certificate
      information of the requesting authenticator.

    6: |
      The RG MUST be able to store certificate information used to
      authenticate the authenticator.

    7: |
      The RG MUST be able to update the information used to validate the
      authenticator by either a firmware upgrade or via updated certificates.

    8: |
      The RG SHOULD be able to update the information used to validate the
      authenticator by updated certificates without a firmware upgrade.

    9: |
      The RG MUST be able to authenticate a minimum of eight authenticators.

    10: |
      When used with IPv4 over Ethernet and DHCPv4, if the RG already has a
      connection when receiving an IEEE 802.1X request, the RG SHOULD
      subsequently perform a DHCPv4 lease renewal upon successful 802.1X
      authentication.

    11: |
      Each RG MUST have a unique factory-installed private/public key pair and
      an embedded ITU-T X.509 version 3 / RFC 5280 [@RFC5280]
      certificate that has been signed by the RG vendor's certificate authority.

    12: |
      The RG certificate MUST have a validity period greater than the
      operational lifetime of the RG.

    13: |
      When used with IPv6 over Ethernet and DHCPv6, if the RG already has a
      connection when receiving an IEEE 802.1X request, the RG SHOULD
      subsequently perform a DHCPv6 CONFIRM upon successful 802.1X
      authentication.
