    xDSL Reporting of Physical Layer Issues

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST be capable of reporting a DSL Re-Initialization Cause Code
      parameter to the Controller. When the RG re-initializes its DSL
      connection, it MUST store, in non-volatile memory, a code indicating the
      cause of the re-initialization. After re-initialization and after a data
      connection is available to the Controller, the RG MUST report to the
      server the cause code. At a minimum, the following cause codes MUST be
      supported:

      1) Autonomous re-initialization of the DSL connection

      2) Loss of local power

      3) External re-initialization, e.g. via a local reset

      4) Cause not determined

    2: |
      The RG MUST support all requirements in ITU-T G.997.1 [@G.997.1] (PLOAM).

    3: |
      The RG MUST be capable of generating threshold-crossing alerts reported
      to the Controller for all mandatory performance-monitoring parameters
      (defined in ITU-T G.997.1 [@G.997.1]) during a data collection interval for which
      threshold values have been assigned.

    4: |
      The RG MUST allow the setting of data collection intervals (per
      ITU-T G.997.1 [@G.997.1]), and reporting schedules to the Controller for performance
      monitoring at all monitoring points of the RG. The RG MUST NOT permit
      modifications to these parameters until the associated data collection
      is deactivated.
