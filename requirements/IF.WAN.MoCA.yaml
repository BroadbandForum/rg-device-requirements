IF.WAN.MoCA:
  name: |
    MoCA

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support a MoCA WAN interface compliant with the MoCA
      Alliance specification. Information regarding the specification is
      available only to members of the MoCA Alliance, further details can be
      obtained from the consortium at http://www.mocalliance.org.

    2: |
      The RG MUST present the MoCA WAN link on an F-connector type coaxial
      connector.

    3: |
      The RG MUST provide a facility to enable or disable the MoCA WAN port
      via the Web GUI, Broadband Forum TR-064i2 [@TR-064i2] interfaces and from a Controller.

      Note: The ability to remotely disable the port is intended for RGs with
      more than one WAN port.

    4: |
      If the RG supports a MoCA WAN interface and additional WAN physical
      interfaces (e.g. xDSL, Ethernet, etc.), the RG SHOULD be able to
      automatically detect and connect through the active interface if only
      one such interface is connected.

    5: |
      If multiple WAN interface types are supported, the RG MUST allow
      configuration via the Web GUI, Broadband Forum TR-064i2 [@TR-064i2] interfaces and from a Controller
      of the default WAN interface that must be used as the active interface.
      This is intended to prevent inadvertent auto-switching between
      interfaces due to user wiring issues or temporary service outages.

    6: |
      If the RG supports a MoCA WAN port and additional WAN physical
      interfaces (e.g. xDSL, Ethernet, etc.), simultaneous use of more than
      one WAN port MUST NOT be supported.

    7: |
      If the RG supports both WAN and LAN MoCA connection, it MUST NOT use the
      same channel for both connections.

    8: |
      The RG port MAY have limited support for only two MoCA devices on the
      MoCA WAN link.

    9: |
      The MoCA WAN port MUST support PER (Packet Error Rate) less than 1E-6 on
      the MoCA link. In this requirement, PER is a measurement of link layer
      error. Any additional PER caused by the dropping of packets as a result
      of the RG saturating the MoCA link is not included in the link layer PER
      specified in this requirement.

    10: |
      The MoCA WAN port MUST support the following configurable parameters:

      * Channel

      * Privacy

      * Security key password (used to generate security keys for the MoCA
      link).

      * Manual or auto-selection of Network Coordinator through interfaces
      such as the Web GUI.

    11: |
      The RG default Security key password MUST comply with the MoCA
      specification.

    12: |
      The RG MAY support configuring a custom Security key password to meet
      service provider requirements.

    13: |
      If the MoCA WAN port can operate on more than one channel the RG MUST
      support channel selection via the Web GUI, Broadband Forum TR-064i2 [@TR-064i2] interfaces and from
      a Controller. The frequency range for MoCA LAN port spans from 850MHz to
      1.5GHz and each MoCA LAN channel covers 50MHz band.

    14: |
      The power control function of a MoCA WAN port MUST comply with the
      following requirements:

      * The adjustable range of output power MUST be at least 25db

      * The target PHY rate is the maximum rate that a MoCA link should
      support.

      * If the measured PHY rate is less than the target PHY rate, it MUST be
      within 30Mbps of the target PHY rate unless the output power is already
      at maximum.

      * The measured PHY rate MAY be greater than the target PHY rate

    15: |
      The MoCA WAN network MUST support the following sustained aggregate MAC
      throughput with PER \< 1E-6 with 50 db attenuation (measured aggregate
      MAC throughput is based on 1500 byte packets, independent of the traffic
      pattern):

      * 125Mbps with 2 MoCA devices in the network

      * 117.5Mbps with 3 MoCA devices in the network

      * 110.5Mbps with 4 MoCA devices in the network

      * 103.8Mbps with 5 MoCA devices in the network

      * 98Mbps with 6 and above MoCA devices in the network.

    16: |
      The device to device ping reply time (round trip) across two MoCA
      devices on the same RF channel MUST be within 7ms on average and 10ms
      maximum.

    17: |
      The RG MUST reach optimal MoCA link layer capacity within 5 minutes
      after power up.

    18: |
      The RG SHOULD reach optimal MoCA link layer capacity within 3 minutes
      after power up.

    19: |
      The RG MUST support sending/receiving packet to/from at least 64 MAC
      addresses on the MoCA interface.

    20: |
      The RG MUST support basic MoCA interface statistics collection,
      parameter provisioning, and diagnostic results display via the Web GUI,
      Broadband Forum TR-064i2 [@TR-064i2] interfaces and from a Controller.
