WAN.DoS:
  name: |
    Denial of Service Prevention

  description: |
    *Note: The IPv6 parts of this module apply only if the RG has an IPv6
    stack.*

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST provide denial of service (DOS) protection for itself and
      all LAN CPE including protection from ping of death, SYN flood, LAND and
      variant attacks. The extent of this protection will be limited when the
      RG is configured as a bridge in which only PPPoE traffic is bridged.
      This protection MUST be available when the RG terminates IP (v4 or v6)
      or bridges IPv4.

    2: |
      The RG MUST reject packets from the WAN with source MAC addresses of
      devices on the local LAN or invalid IP (v4 or v6) addresses
      (e.g. broadcast addresses or IP (v4 or v6) addresses matching those
      assigned to the LAN segment).

    3: |
      The RG MUST reject any unidentified Ethernet packets (i.e. any packet
      that is not associated with IP (v4 or v6) or PPPoE protocols).

    4: |
      The RG MUST perform anti-spoofing filtering for IPv6. All IPv6 traffic
      sent to the WAN from the LAN MUST have an IPv6 source address with a
      prefix assigned to the LAN by the RG, that was delegated from the WAN
      (through DHCPv6 or configuration).

    5: |
      Because the RG must perform anti-spoofing filtering for IPv6, until it
      has an IPv6 LAN prefix delegation it MUST filter all upstream IPv6
      traffic from the home.
