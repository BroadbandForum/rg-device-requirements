IF.WAN.xDSL.BOND:
  name: |
    xDSL Bonding

  requirements:
    1: |
      If the RG supports ATM-based bonding, it MUST comply with ANSI T1.427.01
      [@T1.427.01] and ITU-T G.998.1 [@G.998.1].

    2: |
      If the RG supports Ethernet-based bonding, it MUST comply with
      ANSI T1.427.02 [@T1.427.02] and ITU-T G.998.2 [@G.998.2].

    3: |
      If the RG supports DSL bonding, the RG MAY support the following
      parameters in the Web GUI and in vendor-specific extensions to Broadband Forum TR-064i2 [@TR-064i2]
      and TR-181:

      -- Group parameters (per group instance):

      * Group ID (group number assigned from ATM based xTU-C)

      * Status (valid values include: Operational, Unavailable)

      * Number of links (number of DSL links in the group)

      * RX cell loss (total number of cells lost in the receive direction for
      all ATM links)

      -- Link parameters (per link instance):

      * Group ID (to which the link is a member for all ATM links)

      * Link status (valid values include: Not in use, Standby, Available)

      * Data rate (Should return the TC-layer data rate in bits/sec (in case
      of ATM, the ATM cell rate at the ATM layer after removal of
      idle/incorrect cells)

    4: |
      The RG MUST support the bonding mechanism (as described in requirements
      IF.WAN.xDSL.BOND.1 and .2) associated with the underlying TPS-TC of the
      RG's xDSL link.

    5: |
      When the RG has been configured to perform xDSL bonding of 2 pairs and
      uses a single mini-modular jack to connect to the xDSL lines, it MUST
      search for the signals on the inner pair (pins 3 & 4 for 6-pin, pins 4 &
      5 for 8-pin) and outer pair (pins 2 & 5 for 6-pin, pins 3 & 6 for 8-pin)
      of the jack.

    6: |
      When the RG has been configured to perform xDSL bonding of 2 pairs and
      uses two separate mini-modular jacks to connect to the xDSL lines, the
      pair used to detect the xDSL signal on both jacks MUST be the inner pair
      (pins 3 & 4 for 6-pin, pins 4 & 5 for 8-pin).

    7: |
      If one of the xDSL connections drops, the remaining xDSL connection(s)
      MUST NOT be dropped, provided that the minimum provisioned data rate is
      met.

    8: |
      The RG MUST be clearly labeled indicating that it supports xDSL bonding.

    9: |
      The RG MUST allow manual configuration of the following bonding
      options:

      * DSL line 1 only (single xDSL link on inner pair only if a single
      jack, or jack 1 if presented on separate jacks)

      * DSL line 2 only (single xDSL link on outer pair only if a single
      jack, or jack 2 if presented on separate jacks)

      * xDSL bonding (both xDSL links) using pairs for bonding described in
      IF.WAN.xDSL.BOND.5 and 6).

    10: |
      The Web GUI on the RG MUST indicate when bonding is in use in terms of
      the connection type.

    11: |
      When bonding has been enabled on the RG, the Web GUI, Broadband Forum TR-064i2 [@TR-064i2]
      interfaces and Agent MUST indicate the state of the bonded lines even if
      one is not up.
