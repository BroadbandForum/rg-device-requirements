    LAN.DNSv6- Naming Services (IPv6)

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST act as a DNS server for IPv6-capable LAN devices by
      supporting IPv6 (AAAA) records in its DNS server (per [@RFC3596]) and
      allowing these records to be queried using either IPv4 or IPv6 transport
      ([@RFC3901]).

    2: |
      The RG MUST attach all known (for the host device) globally scoped IPv6
      addresses to the DNS record for a particular host device (see
      LAN.DNS.6), as AAAA records for that device.

    3: |
      The RG SHOULD support dynamic DNS (DDNS) for devices to provide their
      own DNS information. This would override any DNS entries the RG might
      have created for the IP addresses included in the DDNS request.

    4: |
      The RG MUST be able to query for A and AAAA records using either IPv4 or
      IPv6 transport to DNS recursive name servers in the WAN.

    5: |
      The RG SHOULD use a DNS recursive name server obtained through DHCPv6
      option 23 (OPTION_DNS_SERVERS) to query for AAAA records to the WAN, as
      its first choice.

    6: |
      When the RG is proxying DNS queries for LAN devices, it SHOULD use IPv6
      transport regardless of the transport mode used by the LAN device, when
      querying to the WAN. This is only possible if the RG has IPv6 addresses
      for DNS recursive name servers on the WAN.

    7: |
      The RG MUST support receiving at least 2 DNS recursive name server IPv6
      addresses from the network through DHCPv6 option 23 (OPTION_DNS_SERVERS)
      ([@RFC3646]).

    8: |
      The RG SHOULD allow the user to specify that the network-learned or
      user-specified DNS recursive name server addresses be passed back to the
      LAN devices in DHCPv6 responses instead of the RG's address itself as
      the DNS recursive name server(s).

    9: |
      When the RG learns DNS name server addresses from multiple WAN
      connections, the RG SHOULD make recursive query to the DNS name server
      specified with DNS selection policy that is obtained through DHCPv6
      (draft-ietf-mif-dns-server-selection) or manually configured DNS
      selection policy.
