    ALG Functions (IPv4)

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST allow for pass-through of IPv4 traffic in which the payload
      is compressed or encrypted (e.g. VPN traffic).

      This means that, as well as the RG, it must be possible that LAN CPE
      originate PPTP and L2TP sessions to an external network (over IPv4).

    2: |
      The RG MUST allow LAN CPE to originate IPv4 IPsec sessions to an
      external network. This function MUST work properly through the NAPT
      function of the RG.

    3: |
      *This requirement is encompassed by .4*

    4: |
      The RG MUST allow multiple devices on the LAN to launch independent and
      simultaneous IPv4 IPsec sessions. These sessions can be to the same or
      separate destinations.

    5: |
      The RG MUST support LAN device UDP encapsulation of IPv4 IPsec packets
      as defined in RFC 3948 [@RFC3948].

    6: |
      The RG MUST support LAN device negotiation of NAT traversal with IKE as
      identified in RFC 3947 [@RFC3947].

    7: |
      The RG should support a minimum of 4 concurrent LAN IPv4 IPsec sessions
      per LAN device. These sessions can be to the same or separate
      destinations.

    8: |
      The RG MUST seamlessly handle RTSP traffic to LAN devices with no user
      intervention required.

    9: |
      The RG MUST allow the service provider to disable SIP ALG functionality.

    10: |
      The RG MUST be aware of the presence of active SIP clients on the LAN
      side using some rules (e.g. matching IP address, port, or protocol
      number through interception of SIP REGISTER messages).

    11: |
      The SIP ALG function MUST keep track of SIP events (e.g. REGISTER reply
      from the registrar) and maintain allocated resources within the event
      timeout period.
