  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support standard ATM (AAL5) payload format. Note: this
      satisfies Broadband Forum TR-101 R-371.

    2: |
      The RG MUST perform AAL Segmentation and Reassembly (SAR), Convergence
      Sublayer (CS) functions and CRC check.

    3: |
      The RG MUST support encapsulation of bridged Ethernet over AAL5 (without
      FCS) as described in RFC 2684 [@RFC2684].

    4: |
      The RG MUST be able to use both LLC-SNAP and VC-MUX (null) encapsulation
      over AAL5 with all supported protocols. The default MUST be LLC-SNAP.

    5: |
      The RG MAY support encapsulation of IP over AAL5, per RFC 2684 [@RFC2684].

    6: |
      If the RG supports IP over AAL5, it MAY support classical IP according
      to RFC 2225 [@RFC2225].

    7: |
      The RG MUST support ATM CoS. UBR, CBR and VBR-rt MUST be supported, as
      defined in AF-TM-0121.000 [@AF-TM-0121.000].

    8: |
      VBR-nrt and UBR with per VC queuing SHOULD be supported.

    9: |
      The default ATM CoS for the primary VC MUST be UBR.

    10: |
      The RG SHOULD support auto configuration as defined in Broadband Forum
      TR-062 [@TR-062] and ILMI 4.0 and its extensions.

    11: |
      The RG MUST always respond to ATM testing, pings and loopbacks according
      to ITU-T I.610 [@I.610] (F4, F5).

    12: |
      The RG SHOULD support initiating an ATM loopback and receiving the
      reply. This satisfies Broadband Forum TR-101 R-370.

    13: |
      The RG MUST provide a default CPID of all 1s (FFFF). This satisfies
      Broadband Forum TR-101 [@TR-101] R-372.

    14: |
      The RG MUST support 0/35 as the default VPI/VCI for the first PVC or use
      an operator-specific configuration.

    15: |
      The RG MUST be able to perform an auto search for the VPI/VCI settings
      for the first PVC based on a definable search list VPI/VCI sequence
      order.

      If the RG reaches a state of session establishment (e.g. IP when the RG
      is responsible for session termination) after performing the auto
      search, the default VPI/VCI settings MUST be set to the newly discovered
      values. The new default pair MUST be stored on the RG across power off
      situations. If an ATM connection cannot be established after power is
      restored, the search process starts over again.

    16: |
      The RG MUST support the following default VPI/VCI auto-search list
      programmed as a factory default setting in the following sequence, or
      use an operator-specific sequence configuration:

      0/35, 0/38, 8/35, 0/43, 0/51, 0/59, 8/43, 8/51.

      This default list MUST be overwriteable via the methods discussed in
      WAN.ATM.18.

    17: |
      The RG MUST be configurable so that the auto-search mechanism can be
      disabled.

    18: |
      The RG MUST allow the auto-search list to be redefined using TR-064i2
      and interfaces.

    19: |
      The default VPI/VCI values for all PVCs MUST be configurable. The
      default value MUST be utilized prior to performing an auto-search but
      should exclude the default value in the auto-search.

    20: |
      The RG MUST support VPI values from 0 to 255

    21: |
      The RG MUST support VCI values from 32 to 65535
