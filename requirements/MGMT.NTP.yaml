MGMT.NTP:
  name: |
    Network Time Client

  description: |
    This module applies to IPv6 as well as IPv4, but only if the RG has an
    IPv6 stack.

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support an internal clock with a date and time mechanism.

    2: |
      The RG clock MUST be able to be set via an internal time client from an
      Internet source using NTP. The RG SHOULD support NTPv4 (RFC 5905)
      [@RFC5905]. The RG MAY support NTPv3 (RFC 1305) [@RFC1305].

    3: |
      The RG MUST support the use of time server identification by both domain
      name and IP (v4 or v6) address.

    4: |
      If the RG includes default time server values, they SHOULD be specified
      by domain name and not by IP (v4 or v6) address.

    5: |
      The RG MUST support configuring a minimum of 3 NTP servers [@RFC8633].

    6: |
      _Requirement deleted_

    7: |
      The time client SHOULD support DNS responses with CNAMEs or multiple A
      or AAAA records.

    8: |
      The frequency with which the RG updates its time from a time
      server MUST NOT be less than 64 seconds (2^6) as per RFC 5905 [@RFC5905].

    9: |
      The frequency with which the RG updates its time from a time
      server MUST NOT be greater than 36.4 hours (2^17 seconds) as per RFC 5905 [@RFC5905].

    10: |
      The frequency with which the RG updates its time from a time server SHOULD be configurable
      within the specified limits.

    11: |
      The RG MUST support the use of NTPv4 in client mode per section 2 of RFC 5905 [@RFC5905], modes of Operation.

    12: |
      The RG MUST support the use of NTPv4 in client/server protocol mode per section 3 of RFC 5905 [@RFC5905], Protocol Modes.
    
    13: |
      The RG MAY support the use of SNTP protocol per section 14 of RFC 5905 [@RFC5905], Simple Network Time Protocol.

    14: |
      The RG MUST allow configuration of NTP servers using DHCPv4 option 42 and DHCPv6 option 56 in
      accordance with RFC 2132 [@RFC2132] and RFC 5908 [@RFC5908].

    15: |
      The RG SHOULD be able to set the current local time using the local time zone definition encoded 
      either according to IEEE 1003.1 (POSIX) or by reference to the TZ Database. 
      The local time zone definitions are provided using DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 options
      in accordance with RFC 4833 [@RFC4833] or TR-181i2 datamodel parameter (Device.Time.LocalTimeZone).

    16: |
      The RG SHOULD support NTP security mechanism and best practices as described in section 4 and section 5 from RFC 8633 [@RFC8633].

    17: |
      The RG SHOULD support NTS Key Establishment protocol (NTS-KE) as security mechanism for NTP as described
      in section 4 RFC 8915 [@RFC8915].
