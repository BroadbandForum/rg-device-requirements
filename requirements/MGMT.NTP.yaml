    Network Time Client

  description: |
    This module applies to IPv6 as well as IPv4, but only if the RG has an
    IPv6 stack.

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support an internal clock with a date and time mechanism.

    2: |
      The RG clock MUST be able to be set via an internal time client from an
      Internet source using RFC 1305 [@RFC1305].

    3: |
      The RG MUST support the use of time server identification by both domain
      name and IP (v4 or v6) address.

    4: |
      If the RG includes default time server values, they SHOULD be specified
      by domain name and not by IP (v4 or v6) address.

    5: |
      The RG SHOULD allow configuration of the primary and alternate time
      server values in addition to or in place of any default values.

    6: |
      If the RG includes default time server values or if time server values
      are identified in documentation, these values SHOULD be selected using
      industry best practices for NTP and SNTP clients, as published in
      section 10 of RFC 4330 [@RFC4330].

    7: |
      The time client SHOULD support DNS responses with CNAMEs or multiple A
      or AAAA records.

    8: |
      The default frequency with which the RG updates its time from a time
      server MUST NOT be less than 60 minutes, or use an operator-specific
      configuration.

    9: |
      The default frequency with which the RG updates its time from a time
      server MUST NOT be greater than 24 hours, or use an operator-specific
      configuration.

    10: |
      The frequency with which the RG updates its time from a time server
      SHOULD be able to be configured.
