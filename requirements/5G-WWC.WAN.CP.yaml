5G-WWC.WAN.CP:
  name: |
    5G WWC WAN Control Plane

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support the transport of NAS and AS information with the AGF
      as documented in "NAS and AS transport and information elements" section
      of Broadband Forum TR-456 [@TR-456].

    2: |
      The RG SHOULD incorporate a random timing delay prior to attempting to
      initiate establishing 5G control connectivity. This random timing delay
      helps to reduce connection failures when a group of users attempts to
      establish connections to a service provider at the same time (e.g. after
      power is restored to a neighborhood that had a blackout).

    3: |
      The RG MUST use the RG's WAN I/F Ethernet MAC address for the PPPoE 5G
      control plane connection.

    4: |
      The RG that is configured to support both modes of operation MUST be
      able to initiate a PPPoE 5G control plane connection using a NULL length
      service-name tag.

    5: |
      The RG that is configured to only support the 5G-RG mode of operation
      MUST use a PADI with a service-name of 5G (encoded as defined in Broadband Forum TR-456 [@TR-456]
      Section 5.2) when initiating a control plane connection.

    6: |
      An RG that does not receive a PADO in response to a PADI solicitation
      SHOULD re-try immediately to establish the connection. After three
      unsuccessful attempts, the RG SHOULD wait for five minutes, then repeat
      the connection attempt three times. If the PADI still fails, the RG
      SHOULD back off to thirty minute intervals between groups.

    7: |
      The RG attempting to initiate a PPPoE 5G control plane connection MUST
      include the LCP 5G VSO in the LCP Configure-Request.

    8: |
      The RG that receives a Configure-REJ to an LCP configure request
      containing the LCP 5G VSO MUST be able to revert to the FN-RG mode of
      operation and if it is configured to use PPPoE in that mode, continue
      the negotiation accordingly.

    9: |
      The RG that receives a Configure-REJ to an LCP configure request
      containing the LCP 5G VSO that intends to revert to IPoE operation MUST
      issue a PADT to terminate the PPPoE session.

    10: |
      The RG configured to only use the 5G-RG mode of operation, upon receipt
      of a Configure-REJ to a configure request containing the LCP 5G VSO MUST
      resort to an exponential backoff process to reinitiate a PPPoE 5G
      control plane connection.

    11: |
      An RG that is only configured to only use 5G procedures, and is unable
      to establish a 5G control plane connection (LCP Configure-REJ received)
      will issue a PADT to fully terminate the current attempt and then retry
      immediately. If that attempt fails it will delay 5 minutes prior to
      terminating the attempt and retrying. If that attempt fails, after each
      failure it will terminate the current attempt and select a random
      interval between 5 and 20 minutes until the next retry.

    12: |
      Removed.

    13: |
      The RG MUST support NAS protocol to interact with AMF as specified in
      3GPP TS 24.501 [@3GPP-TS.24.501] with modification specified in 3GPP TS 23.316 [@3GPP-TS.23.316]

      Note: The applicability of parameters in NAS messages and the
      applicability of specific NAS message is further defined in this
      document as well as 3GPP TS 23.316 [@3GPP-TS.23.316], and 3GPP TS 24.501 [@3GPP-TS.24.501].

    14: |
      The RG MUST maintain a registration management state and a connection
      management state. The possible values for the registration management
      state are RM-DEREGISTERED and RM-REGISTERED. The possible values for the
      connection management state are CM-IDLE and CM-CONNECTED. The initial RG
      state is RM-DEREGISTERED and CM-IDLE.

    15: |
      The 5G-RG must start a NAS initial Registration procedure, as documented
      in 3GPP TS 23.316 [@3GPP-TS.23.316] Section 7.2.1.1 and Broadband Forum TR-456 [@TR-456] Section "Registration
      Management Procedure for 5G-RG". Upon completion of these procedures the
      RG will be in the RM-REGISTERED, CM-CONNECTED state.

    16: |
      The RG MUST use LCP-ECHO with a default periodicity of 10 seconds to
      monitor NAS channel liveliness.

    17: |
      Upon detection of connectivity failure an RG in the
      RM-REGISTERED/CM-CONNECTED state MUST transition the connection
      management state to CM-IDLE and initiate a deregistration timer to
      either the default value or the value communicated in the in NAS
      Registration Accept message as documented in 3GPP TS 24.501 [@3GPP-TS.24.501]
      clause 8.2.7.17

    18: |
      Upon expiry of the deregistration timer the RG MUST transition the
      registration management state to RM-DEREGISTERED and clean up all 5G
      context state.

    19: |
      An RG that has detected connectivity failure with the network MUST
      attempt to reconnect using the procedures outlined in requirement
      5G-WWC.WAN.CP.16.

    20: |
      An RG that reconnects with the network while in the RM-REGISTERED state
      MUST use a NAS Service Request procedure, as documented int
      3GPP TS 23.316 [@3GPP-TS.23.316] Section 7.2.2.1 and Broadband Forum TR-456 [@TR-456] Section
      "5G-RG Service Request Procedure via W-5GAN", to reestablish service.

    21: |
      An RG that reconnects with the network in the RM-DEREGISTERED state will
      re-establish service using the procedures outlined in requirements 1
      through 15 above AND will cancel the deregistration timer.

    22: |
      An RG that receives a LCP Terminate-Request for the 5G Control plane
      connection will remove all PDU session state, all user plane state and
      terminate the control plane connection.

    23: |
      The RG MUST support RFC 4638 [@RFC4638] procedures for negotiating PPP MTUs larger
      than 1492 bytes.

    24: |
      The RG MUST indicate the maximum PPP MTU it can support in the RFC 4638 [@RFC4638]
      PPP-Max-Payload tag.

    25: |
      The RG MUST initiate LCP negotiations with the value it provided in the
      PPP-Max-Payload tag if echoed by the AGF, else falls back to 1492 as per
      RFC 2516 [@RFC2516].

    26: |
      The RG MUST use the MIN of negotiated PPP MTU and IPv4 Link MTU
      Parameter received via PCO at PDU Session Establishment time as the MTU
      for 5WE encapsulated IPv4 packets

    27: |
      The RG MUST use the MIN of negotiated PPP MTU and MTU option in the IPv6
      RA received at PDU Session Establishment time for 5WE encapsulated IPv6
      packets

  after: |
    Note: PLMN selection defined in 3GPP TS 22.011 [@3GPP-TS.22.011] and in [@3GPP-TS.23.122]
    are not applicable as described in clause 4.2.1 3GPP TS 23.316 [@3GPP-TS.23.316].
