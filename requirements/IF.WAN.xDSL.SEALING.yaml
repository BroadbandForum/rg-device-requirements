    DC Sealing Current

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST provide for the termination of sealing current on either, or
      both, DSL line pairs. A sample circuit implementation reference diagram
      is provided in Appendix V.

    2: |
      The DC termination for sealing current MUST be capable of conducting at
      least 20mA of current.

    3: |
      The DC termination MUST meet the requirements as specified in Annex I of
      ITU-T G.992.3 [@G.992.3].

    4: |
      A low-pass filter MUST be in place between the DC termination and the
      DSL line. The filter MUST meet the following requirements, which are
      based on xDSL in-line filter requirements in ANSI T1.421 [@T1.421-2001]:

      * It MUST introduce less than 25 Ohms DC resistance tip-ring when the
      DC termination side is shorted.

      * It MUST have an impedance, from either conductor to ground, greater
      than 5 MΩ.

      * The capacitance, from either conductor to ground, MUST be less than 1
      nF on the loop side

      * The attenuation MUST be at least 65 dB between 25 kHz -- 12.0 MHz.

      * The input impedance, looking from network side into the LPF when
      terminated in the ON state on the termination side, MUST result in a
      bridging loss on the DSL line of not more than 0.25 dB, when measured at
      any frequency between 25 kHz and 12.0 MHz.

      * The DC resistance between tip and ring, when the DC termination side
      is open, MUST be at least 3.5 MΩ.

      * The input impedance, looking from the network side into the LPF when
      terminated in the ON state on the termination side, MUST result in a
      bridging loss in the voice band of not more than 0.5 dB, when measured
      at any frequency between 200 Hz and 4.0 kHz.

    5: |
      The RG MUST support enabling and disabling of the DC termination
      capability through its local Web GUI, Broadband Forum TR-064i2 [@TR-064i2] interfaces and from the
      Controller.

    6: |
      The RG SHOULD be able to detect the presence of POTS service on a line.

    7: |
      If POTS is detected by the RG, the termination MUST NOT be applied.
