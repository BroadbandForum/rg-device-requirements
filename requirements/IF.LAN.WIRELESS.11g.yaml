    Wireless: 802.11g Access Point

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG SHOULD have internal antennas.

    2: |
      The RG MUST NOT have an antenna that limits coverage to a single
      direction.

    3: |
      The RG MUST include an effective multi-antenna (at least 2) design for
      diversity reception.

    4: |
      The RG SHOULD include an effective multi-antenna (at least 2) design for
      diversity transmit.

    5: |
      The RG SHOULD support use of an external antenna(s) for improved
      performance beyond the requirements identified here.

    6: |
      The RG SHOULD have separate antennas for transmit and receive.

    7: |
      If an external antenna can be used with the RG, the RG SHOULD have a
      robust connector (e.g. be durable and not accidentally come off) for
      this connection.

    8: |
      The RG's Wi-Fi access point MUST have a maximum transmit power (EIRP)
      equal to or greater than 200 mW (23.01 dBm) when operating in the
      802.11b mode.

    9: |
      The RG's Wi-Fi access point MUST have a maximum transmit power (EIRP)
      equal to or greater than 100 mW (20 dBm) when operating in the 802.11g
      mode.

    10: |
      The RG's Wi-Fi access point output power MUST be configurable between a
      minimum of 30 mW and the maximum capable from the RG.

    11: |
      The RG Wi-Fi access point MUST meet the following minimum receiver
      sensitivity, maximum allowable path loss (computed as EIRP-receiver
      sensitivity) and delay spread tolerance specifications:

      | **Data Rate** | **RX Sensitivity** | **Max. Allowable Path Loss Delay Spread** | **Tolerance at \< 1% FER**
      |---------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
      | *802.11b* | | | |
      | 11 Mbps | -82 dBm | 104 dB | 65 ns |
      | 5.5 Mbps | -87 dBm | 107 dB | 225 ns |
      | 2 Mbps | -90 dBm | 110 dB | 400 ns |
      | 1 Mbps | -93 dBm | 113 dB | 500 ns |
      | *802.11g* | | | |
      | 54 Mbps | -71 dBm | 87 dB | 120 ns |
      | 48 Mbps | -73 dBm | 89 dB | 120 ns |
      | 36 Mbps | -77 dBm | 93 dB | 240 ns |
      | 24 Mbps | -80 dBm | 96 dB | 240 ns |
      | 18 Mbps | -82 dBm | 98 dB | 300 ns |
      | 12 Mbps | -86 dBm | 102 dB | 300 ns |
      | 9 Mbps | -87 dBm | 103 dB | 300 ns |
      | 6 Mbps | -89 dBm | 105 dB | 300 ns |

    12: |
      The RG Wi-Fi access point MUST have an effective automatic data rate
      selection algorithm to allow the system to work close to its specified
      receiver sensitivity so as to maximize the AP coverage and throughput.

    13: |
      The RG MUST be Wi-Fi CERTIFIED for IEEE 802.11g [@802.11].
