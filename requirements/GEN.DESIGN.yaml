  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST be compact and have a physical profile suitable for a
      desktop.

    2: |
      The RG SHOULD be able to be wall mounted and stand on its side.

    3: |
      The RG MAY have the ability to be mounted horizontally or vertically.

    4: |
      If wall mounted, the RG SHOULD be oriented so that the cabling is routed
      toward the ground in order to reduce strain on the cabling.

    5: |
      A detachable wall-mounting bracket MAY be added to the RG.

    6: |
      The power connector at the RG MUST be securely connected to avoid
      accidental disconnect. This means that the connector MUST be either
      secured via a clip to the box or be held in place with significant force
      so that it does not readily pull out by minor pulling on the power cord.

    7: |
      If the power supply is external to the RG, it SHOULD be labeled with the
      RG vendor's name and the model number of the RG.

    8: |
      If the power supply is external to the RG it SHOULD be either small
      enough, or appropriately positioned on the power cord, so as not to
      block other power outlets.

    9: |
      If the power cable includes an AC to DC conversion brick, that brick MAY
      have a light on it.

    10: |
      The RG MUST NOT be USB powered.

    11: |
      The RG MUST NOT use the local phone loop for power.

    12: |
      The model and serial number of the RG MUST be visible via external
      markings on the RG.

    13: |
      The model and serial number of the RG MUST be visible via external
      markings on the RG packaging.

    14: |
      If a console port used for local technician configuration is provided on
      the RG, it SHOULD NOT be physically accessible to end users (e.g. it
      should not be placed on the outside of the device).

    15: |
      The RG MUST have a single function reset button in order to reset the
      device to the default factory settings.
