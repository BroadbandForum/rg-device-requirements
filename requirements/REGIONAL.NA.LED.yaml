REGIONAL.NA.LED:
  name: |
    North American LED Indicators

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST have at a minimum the following indicator lights (labeling
      of all ports is subject to localized requirements):

      Power Ethernet Broadband Internet

    2: |
      All physical ports and bridged connection types on the RG
      (e.g. Ethernet, USB, Wireless, HomePlug, G.hn, HomePNA, 1394, etc...)
      MUST have a link integrity indicator lamp on the RG (1 per port if a
      separate physical port is present or per connection type if a separate
      port is not present).

    3: |
      The indicator lights MUST be in the order as indicated in requirement
      REGIONAL.NA.LED.1 in a left to right or top to bottom orientation.

    4: |
      Port indicator lights for all additional LAN Interfaces (beyond the
      standard Ethernet indicator) MUST be placed between the "Ethernet" and
      "Broadband" lights defined in requirement REGIONAL.NA.LED.1 (note that
      labeling of all ports is subject to localized requirements).

    5: |
      All port indicator lights MUST be located on the front of the RG unless
      summary indicator lights are used.

    6: |
      Physical port indicator lights MAY be located next to the port and other
      than on the front of the RG, so long as there is a summary indicator
      light for the associated interface type with the other port indicator
      lights on the front of the unit.

      For example, there may be Ethernet port indicator lights located on the
      back of the RG by each Ethernet connection as long as there is a summary
      indicator for the Ethernet connections on the front of the RG in the
      standard location.

    7: |
      The indicator lights MUST be readily visible (99% human observer
      detection in less than 250 milliseconds) at 4 meters with an ambient
      illumination level of 5920 meter-candles. Visibility MUST be maintained
      over a horizontal viewing angle of +/- 80 degrees and a vertical viewing
      angle of -20 to +45 degrees off the central axis.

    8: |
      When flashing, the indicator lights MUST flash at 4 Hz with a duty cycle
      of 50% (except as specified otherwise in this document).

    9: |
      The RG MUST have an On/Off power indicator light. The power indicator
      MUST function as follows:

      Solid Green = Power on

      Off = Power off

      Red = POST (power on self test) failure (not bootable) or RG
      malfunction. A malfunction is any error of internal sequence or state
      that will prevent the RG from connecting to the access network or
      passing customer data. This may be identified at various times such
      after power on or during operation through the use of self testing or in
      operations that result in a unit state that is not expected or should
      not occur.

    10: |
      The RG MUST have an indicator light that indicates broadband interface
      layer connectivity. This indicator MUST function as follows:

      Solid green = Broadband physical connection is established (e.g. DSL
      sync)

      Off = Broadband interface powered off, no signal detected

      Flashing green = Signal detected, in process of synchronizing

      Flashing at 2 Hz with a 50% duty cycle when trying to detect carrier
      signal

      Flashing at 4 Hz with a 50% duty cycle when the carrier has been
      detected and trying to train

    11: |
      If additional broadband interfaces (2 or more) are supported that
      operate simultaneously with the primary broadband link (e.g. xDSL
      bonding, Ethernet simultaneous with xDSL, etc.), the RG MUST support a
      broadband light to indicate the status of each link. The behavior for
      this indicator MUST follow the requirements described in
      REGIONAL.NA.LED.10.

    12: |
      The RG MUST have an Internet indicator light that indicates whether or
      not it has at least one broadband WAN interface active. This indicator
      MUST function as follows:

      Solid green = IP connected (the RG has a WAN IP address from
      IPCP/DHCP/static and broadband link is up) and no traffic detected. If
      the IP or PPPoE session is dropped due to an idle timeout, the light
      will remain green if an ADSL connection is still present. If the session
      is dropped for any other reason, the light is turned off. The light will
      turn red when it attempts to reconnect and DHCP or PPPoE fails.

      Off = Broadband physical connection power off, RG in bridged mode with
      no IP address assigned to the RG, or broadband physical interface
      connection not present

      Flickering green = IP connected and IP traffic is passing thru the RG
      (either direction)

      Red = RG attempted to become IP connected and failed (no 802.1X, DHCP,
      PPPoE, PPPoA response or authentication failure, etc.)

    13: |
      A LAN interface physical port indicator light MUST function as follows:

      Solid green = Powered device connected to the associated port (includes
      devices with wake-on-LAN capability where a slight voltage is supplied
      to an Ethernet connection)

      Flickering green = LAN activity present (traffic in either direction)

      Off = No activity, RG power off, no cable or no powered device connected
      to the associated port.

    14: |
      If the RG supports the Wi-Fi protected setup (WPS) pushbutton
      configuration (PBC) method (IF.LAN.WIRELESS.AP.11), the RG SHOULD have a
      two-color LED to display the status of WPS PBC. The operation of this
      LED SHOULD be as described in 4.8.1.3 "WPS LED operation" below.

    15: |
      The indicator for Wi-Fi protected setup pushbutton method, if present,
      MUST be located within close proximity to the pushbutton or next to the
      Wireless status indicator.

  after:
    |
    #### WPS LED operation - WLAN WPS PBC Security

    * Green - On for 5min or until pressed again

    The Wi-Fi protected setup (WPS, previously called “simple config”) has been completed successfully.

    * Green Slow flash (2 Hz 50% duty cycle)

    The Wi-Fi protected setup PBC procedure is in progress.

    * Red - Solid

    Error unrelated to security, such as failed to find any partner, or protocol
    prematurely aborted. Recommended user action - press WPS button to start
    protocol again.

    * Red - Fast flash (4 Hz 50% duty cycle)

    Session overlap detected (possible security risk). Recommended user action -
    Wait for 2 minutes, then press WPS button again to reattempt. If the
    condition recurs, refer the user to PIN-based configuration method.

    * Off

    The device is ready for another PBC authentication

    *Note - This is a deviation from the three color indicator option and
    behaviors described by the Wi-Fi Alliance, which however, will not
    enforce any LED behavior as part of its WPS certification process.*
