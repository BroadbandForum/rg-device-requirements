WAN.CONNECT.ON-DEMAND:
  name: |
    On-Demand Connection Establishment

  description: |
    The On-demand Connection function applies only to IPv4 connections.
    However, when IPv6 is present, its behavior must take the presence of
    IPv6 into consideration as described in this module

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support a "connect on demand" option for IPv4 connections
      that run over PPP. In this mode, the connection to the broadband network
      is initiated when outbound traffic is encountered from the local LAN and
      terminated after a timeout period in which no traffic occurs.

    2: |
      If the PPP session only contains IPv4, then the RG MUST terminate the
      PPP session in accordance with WAN.CONNECT.ON-DEMAND.1, and any
      associated PPPoE session (if applicable).

    3: |
      If the PPP session contains IPv4 and IPv6, then the RG MUST terminate
      only the IPv4 session. This is done using IPCP commands.

    4: |
      The RG MUST support a "connect on demand" option for IPv4 connections
      that run over Ethernet.

    5: |
      To determine whether a connection has IPv4 activity during a timeout
      interval, the RG MUST consider only traffic with an IPv4 ethertype.

    6: |
      The interval after which a connection timeout occurs MUST be able to be
      configured.

    7: |
      A default timeout of 20 minutes SHOULD be used for connection timeouts
      or use an operator-specific configuration.

    8: |
      If the RG has an active IPv6 connection, and does not have addresses for
      DNS recursive name servers to be accessed over IPv6, then the "connect
      on demand" option MUST be disabled.
