WAN.DHCPC.BFDecho:
  name: |
    BFD echo

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG SHOULD support configuration of the BFD echo functionality, as
      per RFC 5881 [@RFC5881], for both IPv4 and
      IPv6.

    2: |
      The RG SHOULD support sending BFD echo packet(s) on its WAN interface at
      regular intervals using a recommended default of 30s. The destination IP
      address of such packets MUST be taken from the list of IP addresses
      assigned to or via the WAN interface, including the Subnet-Router
      address of an IPv6 DHCPv6 delegated prefix.

    3: |
      The RG SHOULD support receiving self-originated BFD echo packets
      addressed to its assigned address or the Subnet-Router IPv6 delegated
      prefix.

    4: |
      Unless overridden by configuration, by default after a failure of 3
      successive BFD echo intervals, the RG MUST issue a DHCP renew message
      following a random jitter interval between 1 and 30 seconds.
