    5G WWC ATSSS

  description: |
    Access traffic steering switching and splitting (ATSSS) is used to
    permit a 5G-RG to simultaneously utilize both a 3GPP radio interface and
    non-3GPP wireline interface. The 3GPP radio interface may be with either
    a E-UTRAN (4G) or NG-RAN (5G). Requirements are specified for 5G
    operation, and 4G operation via EPC interworking.

    Note that for the BBF WWC work, roaming on either interface is
    considered to be out of scope. What is in scope is referred to as
    Non-roaming and Roaming with Local Breakout architecture for ATSSS
    support in 3GPP TS.23.501 [@3GPP-TS.23.501].

    3GPP TS 23.502 [@3GPP-TS.23.502] defines the procedures and 3GPP TS 24.193 [@3GPP-TS.24.193] provides the stage 3
    definition. Impacts to the NAS protocol for ATSSS is described in TS
    24.501.

    A rough narrative of operation is that:

    1. 5G-RG registers with a common PLMN on both the 3GPP and non-3GPP interfaces.
    In case the non-3GPP connectivity is available, the 5G-RG attempts to
    register via the non-3GPP interface first, because the Multi-Access PDU
    session from the 5G-RG can be initiated via the 3GPP interface, which
    requests the WAgfInfo availability in AMF and SMF to enable the co-located
    UPF selection. A security context is established with the first
    registration that is simply referenced by the second association via the
    5G-GUTI.

    2. The 5G-RG establishes a multi-access (MA) PDU session. Note that both
    the 3GPP radio and wireline interfaces may be 5G, or the 3GPP radio
    interface may be via LTE and employing EPS interworking. When both
    interfaces are 5G, this can be done with a single MA-PDU session
    establish request, assuming that the 5G-RG is already registered in both
    accesses before initiating the PDU Session Establishment procedure. When
    the radio interface is a E-UTRA interface, the 'legs' of the MA-PDU
    session must be separately established. During session establishment the
    5G-RG is provided with ATSSS Rules that contain traffic distribution
    policies.

    3. The 5G RG distributes traffic across the set of upstream interfaces
    according to ATSSS Rules received from the 5G System.

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support ATSSS as is described in 3GPP TS.23.501 [@3GPP-TS.23.501]

    2: |
      The RG MUST support at least one of ATSSS-LL and MP-TCP proxy operation

    3: |
      The RG MUST support the following MA-PDU session lifecycle maintenance
      procedures described in 3GPP TS 23.502 [@3GPP-TS.23.502] and specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [@3GPP-TS.24.501] and TS
      24.193 with UE replaced by RG. The clauses referenced below refer to TS
      23.502.

      * UE requested MA-PDU session establishment (Non roaming or roaming
      with local breakout) as per clause 4.22.2.1

      * UE Requested PDU Session Establishment with Network Modification to
      MA PDU Session as per clause 4.22.3

      * Access Network Performance Measurements as per clause 4.22.4

      * Reporting of Access Availability as per clause 4.22.5

      * Adding / Re-activating / De-activating User-Plane Resources as per
      clause 4.22.7

      * UE or network requested MA PDU Session Modification as per clause
      4.22.8

      * Connection, Registration and Mobility Management procedures as per
      clause 4.22.9

      * UE or network requested MA PDU Session Release (non-roaming and
      roaming with local breakout) per clause 4.22.10.2

    4: |
      The RG MUST support EPC Interworking procedures for ATSSS as described
      in clause 4.22.6 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [@3GPP-TS.23.502] and specified in 3GPP TS 24.193 [@3GPP-TS.24.193], in both cases
      with UE replaced by RG.

    5: |
      The RG MUST attempt to register via the wireline access first. (note:
      this will ensure the SMF can have the wAgfInfo available for the
      co-located UPF selection.)
