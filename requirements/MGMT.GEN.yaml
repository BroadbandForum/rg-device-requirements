    General

  requirements:
    1: |
      Configuration and installation of the RG SHOULD minimize the number of
      restarts of the RG when enabling changes.

    2: |
      If software is loaded on LAN CPE for installation or configuration of
      the RG, this software MUST NOT require the associated LAN CPE to
      restart, except in the case of the installation of networking drivers
      (e.g. USB, wireless, etc.) or a change in IP address assignment
      (e.g. static to DHCP, public to private, private to public or assignment
      of a specific IP address using DHCP).

    3: |
      The RG MUST maintain an internal log of WAN side connection flows
      (e.g. WAN link layer, DHCP, IP and PPP sessions). At a minimum, the log
      MUST record the last 250 events. This includes WAN physical interface
      events initiated locally or by the access network. The purpose of the
      log is to provide a troubleshooting aid in resolving line and connection
      problems.

    4: |
      The RG MUST timestamp each log entry.

    5: |
      The factory default timestamp value for log entries SHOULD indicate the
      elapsed time since the unit was first powered on. The log entry
      timestamp SHOULD be formatted, consistent with ISO 8601, as follows:

      * PYYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss

      where:

      * P = the letter "P" used to indicate that what follows is a time interval
      (period) data element

      * YYYY = number of years (digits)

      * MM = number of months (digits, 00 -- 11; 1 month is the equivalent of 30
      days for time interval purposes)

      * DD = number of days (digits, 00 -- 29)

      * hh = number of hours (digits, 00 -- 23)

      * mm = number of minutes (digits, 00 -- 59)

      * ss = number of seconds (digits, 00 -- 59)

      Once the RG has established connectivity to an Internet based time
      server, all log entry timestamps SHOULD be formatted for GMT or user
      specified time zone (24 hour military format), consistent with ISO 8601,
      as follows:

      * YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss±hh:mm or

      * YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ ,

      where:

      * YYYY = year (digits)

      * MM = month (digits, 01 -- 12)

      * DD = day of month (digits, 01 -- 31)

      * T = the letter "T", used to indicate the start of the time of day

      * Z = the letter "Z", used to indicate that the time is UTC (Coordinated
      Universal Time)

      * hh = hours (digits, 00 -- 23)

      * mm = minutes (digits, 00 -- 59)

      * ss = seconds (digits, 00 -- 59)

      * ±hh:mm = the difference between local time and UTC in hours and minutes (e.g. -05:00 would indicate Eastern Standard Time, 5 hours behind UTC)

    6: |
      The RG MUST have diagnostic information available that allows the user
      to identify the precise nature of any connection or performance problem.
      It MUST be able to indicate if the problem is at the physical layer,
      ATM, Ethernet, PPP, or IP layer. This information MUST be accessible
      from the Web GUI, TR-064i4 interfaces and from a Controller.

    7: |
      The RG MUST have an embedded ICMP ping client capable of being initiated
      via the Web GUI interfaces and from a Controller to ping to WAN and LAN
      side IP addressable devices.

    8: |
      The RG log SHOULD reside on the RG and persist across power loss.

    9: |
      The RG log SHOULD NOT interfere with the normal performance of the RG.
      That is, writing log entries to non-volatile storage SHOULD NOT be done
      at a priority or in a manner that would degrade the user experience nor
      the connection throughput.

    10: |
      The RG MUST be able to start training, establish a network connection
      and respond to network tests by default upon power up prior to any
      additional configuration or software installation on the associated PC.
      The absence of a PC MUST have no effect on these operations.
