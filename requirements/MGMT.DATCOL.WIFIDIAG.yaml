    Wi-Fi Diagnostics Data Collection

  description: |
    For measuring the WiFi experience in the home, these requirements
    specify which data is continuously collected about the state and
    performance of the home Wi-Fi network(s).

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support the collection of these operation parameters for
      each AP device it controls (integrated or connected in the home network)
      :

      * MAC address

      * Number of radios

    2: |
      The RG SHOULD support the collection of these parameters for each AP
      device it controls (integrated or in home network) :

      * Name

      * Model/Serial Number

      * HW/SW Version

      * CPU Usage

      * Memory Usage

    3: |
      The RG MUST support the collection of these operation parameters for
      each radio per AP device it controls (integrated or connected in the
      home network) :

      * MAC address

      * State

      * Current operating Channel

      * Current channel bandwidth

      * Current frequency band (2,4GHz, 5Ghz, 60Ghz)

      * WiFi signal strength (% of transmit power)

      The RG SHOULD support the collection of these operation parameters for
      each radio per AP device it controls (integrated or connected in the
      home network) :

      * Country code

      * Channel Utilization (Total, Transmit, Receive)

      * Noise

    4: |
      The RG MUST support the collection of these neighborhood (channel scan)
      parameters from each radio per AP device it controls (integrated or
      connected in the home network):

      * Seen Channels and utilization

    5: |
      The RG SHOULD support the collection of these neighborhood station
      information from each radio per AP device it controls (integrated or
      connected in the home network):

      * BSSID

      * SSID

      * SignalStrength

    6: |
      The RG MUST support the collection of these configuration parameters for
      each AP per radio on all AP devices it controls:

      * BSSID

      * Encryption Mode (WEP, WPA2, WPAÂ§ etc.)

      * Number of AP

      * SSID Advertisement status (on/off)

    7: |
      The RG MUST support the collection of these station parameters for each
      AP it controls:

      * Number of Connected Wireless Devices (STAs)

    8: |
      The RG MUST support the collection of these Wi-Fi station parameters per
      AP for each connected device (STA):

      * MAC address

      * Operating standard

      * CurrentUplinkRate

      * CurrentDownLinkRate

    9: |
      The RG SHOULD support the collection of these Wi-Fi station parameters
      per AP for each connected device (STA):

      * IP addresses (IPV4/IPv6)

      * Hostname

    10: |
      The RG SHOULD support the collection of these Wi-Fi station statistics
      for each connected device (STA):

      * Bytes and Packets send

      * Bytes and Packets received

      * Errors Sent and received
