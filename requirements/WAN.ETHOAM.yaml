WAN.ETHOAM:
  name: |
    Ethernet OAM

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support a maintenance end point (MEP) at the customer and
      access link levels on a per VLAN basis. Note: The multi-PVC case is for
      further study. This satisfies Broadband Forum TR-101 [@TR-101] R-285, R-294.

    2: |
      The RG MUST support a default ME level value of 5 for the customer
      level. This satisfies TR-101 [@TR-101] R-286.

    3: |
      The RG SHOULD support a loopback message (LBM) function at the customer
      level that can generate a multicast LBM toward its peer MEP(s). This
      satisfies TR-101 [@TR-101] R-287.

    4: |
      The RG MUST support a loopback reply (LBR) function at the customer
      level toward its peer MEP(s) in response to both unicast and multicast
      LBMs. This satisfies TR-101 [@TR-101] R-288.

    5: |
      The RG MUST support a linktrace reply (LTR) function at the customer
      level toward its peer MEP(s). This satisfies TR-101 [@TR-101] R-289.

    6: |
      For business customers and/or premium customers requiring proactive
      monitoring, the RG SHOULD support generating continuity check messages
      (CCMs) at the customer level. This satisfies TR-101 [@TR-101] R-290.

    7: |
      The RG MUST support turning off sending of CCMs at the customer level,
      while keeping the associated MEP active. This satisfies TR-101 [@TR-101] R-291.

    8: |
      The RG MUST support receiving AIS messages at the customer level. This
      satisfies TR-101 [@TR-101] R-292.

    9: |
      The RG SHOULD trigger the appropriate alarms for loss of continuity at
      the customer level. This satisfies TR-101 [@TR-101] R-293.

    10: |
      The RG MUST support a default ME level value of 1 for the access link
      level. This satisfies TR-101 [@TR-101] R-295.

    11: |
      The RG SHOULD support a loopback message (LBM) function at the access
      link level that can generate a multicast LBM toward its peer MEP(s).
      This requirement allows the RG to dynamically learn the MAC address of
      the AN MEP, and test the connectivity to that MEP. This satisfies TR-101 [@TR-101]
      R-296.

    12: |
      The RG MUST support a loopback reply (LBR) function at the access link
      level toward its peer MEP(s), in response to both unicast and multicast
      LBMs. This satisfies TR-101 [@TR-101] R-297.

    13: |
      The RG MUST issue a DHCP renewal message following a random delay
      between 1 and 30 seconds after it detects a restoration of Ethernet
      continuity at the customer ME level.
