IF.LAN.Ghn:
  name: |
    G.hn (LAN)

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST comply with ITU-T Recommendations G.9960 [@G.9960], G.9961 [@G.9961] and
      G.9964 [@G.9964].

    2: |
      The RG must support at least one of the following connector options for
      G.hn:

      a) F-connector coaxial interface

      b) Modular RJ-11 style phone interface (optionally RJ-14 or RJ-45)

      c) Powerline

    3: |
      The G.hn interface type (coax, powerline or twisted pair) MUST be
      configurable and persistent across RG restarts and reboots. The G.hn
      interface parameters configuration MUST be supported through the Web
      GUI, UPnP (if present) and from a Controller

    4: |
      The RG MUST support the enabling/disabling of each G.hn interface. The
      default MUST be enabled or use an operator-specific configuration.

    5: |
      The RG MUST periodically collect G.hn Ethernet layer and channel
      performance data and report this data via Web GUI, UPnP (if present) and
      from a Controller.

    6: |
      The RG MUST be able to provide physical media performance data related
      to at least 10 associated G.hn network devices on every G.hn interface
      and report this data via Web GUI, UPnP (if present) and from a
      Controller.

    7: |
      The RG MUST implement sufficient filtering and isolation to the G.hn and
      any other wireline interfaces to prevent interference. E.g. if the RG
      supports both xDSL and G.hn, it MUST implement sufficient filtering and
      isolation between G.hn and xDSL to avoid interfering with each other's
      spectrum.

    8: |
      The RG MUST be able to prioritize downstream network traffic based on
      IEEE 802.1Q user priorities for relative QoS by supporting at least 2
      egress priority queues on every G.hn port.

    9: |
      The RG SHOULD be able to reserve bandwidth (media access time) on the
      G.hn network for services requesting QoS guarantees so as to meet QoS
      requirements for throughput (rate), latency and jitter, as described in
      clause 8.6.2 of ITU-T G.9961 [@G.9961].

    10: |
      The RG SHOULD enable provisioning of QoS classification filters and
      traffic specifications in the G.hn device, as specified in clause
      8.6.2.3.1 of ITU-T G.9961 [@G.9961].

    11: |
      The RG MUST support configuring a custom network security key password
      to meet service provider requirements, as defined in clause 9.0 of
      ITU-T G.9961 [@G.9961].
