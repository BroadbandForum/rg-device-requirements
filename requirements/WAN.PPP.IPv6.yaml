WAN.PPP.IPv6:
  name: |
    PPP Client for establishment of IPv6 connection

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST support IPv6 over PPP per RFC 5072 [@RFC5072] and RFC 5172 [@RFC5172].

    2: |
      The RG MUST support establishment of an IPv6 over PPPoE connection
      according to the flow in Annex A.1.

    3: |
      The RG MUST allow any particular PPP connection to be configurable for
      IPv4 only, IPv6 only, or both.

    4: |
      If the RG is configured for multiple PPPoE connections, it MUST be
      possible to configure it to use the same login and password for all, so
      that only the domain is unique per connection.

    5: |
      The RG MUST NOT tear down a shared (IPv4 and IPv6) PPP session if error
      conditions prevent only one IP stack (either IPv4 or IPv6) from working.
      The session MUST be torn down if error conditions apply to both stacks.
