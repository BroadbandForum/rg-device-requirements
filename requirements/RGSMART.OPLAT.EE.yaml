  name: |
    Execution Environment

  requirements:
    1: |
      The native operator system on a RG MUST provide an execution environment
      (EE), which allows the execution of applications (containers).

      *Note: It is recommended that the RG provides a LXC runtime environment
      that supports C Plug-in bundle expansion capabilities*

    2: |
      The execution environment MUST support the isolation of all executed
      applications from each other and from other application on RG.

    3: |
      The applications SHOULD run with a non-root minimum privilege level with
      as few rights as possible. (Principle of least privilege).

    4: |
      The execution environment MUST provide access to socket based outgoing
      communication and TLS encryption for the applications and allow them to
      communicate with cloud services.

    5: |
      The execution environment MUST allow configuring the deployed
      applications using centralized RG configuration data and interfaces.

    6: |
      The execution environment MUST provide controlled access to the RG
      managed configuration parameters, for application use. The access rights
      have to be configurable.

      *Note: For example, a Wi-Fi control application has to be able to read
      and write the SSID.*

    7: |
      The execution environment SHOULD provide an inter-application
      communication mechanism, which allows the communication between
      different applications.

      *Note: It is recommended that communication mechanism is based on an
      event publish and subscribe model.*
