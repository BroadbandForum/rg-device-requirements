WAN.BRIDGE:
  name: |
    Bridging

  description: |
    *Note that the IPv6 parts of this module apply only if the RG supports
    IPv6.*

  requirements:
    1: |
      The RG MUST be able to bridge IPv4 over Ethernet.

    2: |
      The RG MUST be a learning bridge as defined in IEEE 802.1D for all
      logical and physical Ethernet interfaces, supporting a minimum of 272
      MAC addresses.

    3: |
      If bridge mode is enabled for IPv4 on the RG by default for LAN
      connected devices, the RG MUST be able to support additional connections
      to a Controller for remote management addressability (using direct
      DHCPv4 or static IPv4, PPP, etc.), and connections for any locally
      terminated service that require IP (v4 or v6) addressability
      (e.g. gateway integrated voice ATA ports, etc.).

      Note that this special bridge mode that includes a device remote
      management session connection requires an additional WAN connection from
      the network. This requirement is considered conditional as a result of
      the network side dependency, but the RG must support this type of
      configuration.

    4: |
      The RG MUST be able to bridge IPv6 over Ethernet (Ethertype 0x86DD).
      This includes bridging of multicast frames.

    5: |
      The RG MUST be able to configure IPv6 bridging for a WAN interface,
      separate from IPv4 treatment.

    6: |
      The RG MUST be able to configure IPv6 bridging separately for each WAN
      interface (if there are multiple WAN interfaces).

    7: |
      When IPv6 bridging is enabled on a WAN interface, the RG MUST be
      configurable to act as a host on that WAN interface (doing SLAAC, etc.).
      It will not request IA_PD, since that is not a host function.
