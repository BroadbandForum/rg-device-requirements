GEN.OPS:
  name: |
    Device Operation

  requirements:
    1: |
      All RG firmware and associated system files MUST be pre-installed.

    2: |
      The RG MUST operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week without the need to
      reboot.

    3: |
      The MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) of the RG and operating system
      SHOULD be equal to or exceed 1 year (e.g. it should not need a reboot
      more than one time per year).

    4: |
      The life expectancy of the RG SHOULD be at least seven years.

    5: |
      The RG SHOULD tolerate power fluctuations and brown-outs, continuing to
      operate normally and maintaining its configuration after these events.

    6: |
      The RG SHOULD be able to detect faults and reset appropriately upon
      detection.

    7: |
      The RG SHOULD include sufficient non-volatile memory to accommodate
      future control and data plane protocol upgrades over a minimum of four
      years. The potential upgrades may include: initiating and terminating
      signaling protocols at IP and ATM layers; logic for packet
      classification, policing, forwarding, traffic shaping and QoS support at
      IP, Ethernet and ATM layers.

    8: |
      The RG MUST preserve local configuration information during power-off
      and power interruption.

    9: |
      The RG MUST complete power up in 60 seconds or less.

    10: |
      The RG SHOULD be self-installable by an end user in under 20 minutes
      assuming the default configuration and mode of operation. This is the
      time from when the box is opened to when the user is using the service
      including any driver installation (assuming no network complications and
      excluding micro-filter installation and customer ordering/registration).

    11: |
      Other than networking drivers (e.g. USB, wireless, etc...), other
      software or drivers MUST NOT be required on computers and other devices
      for proper and full use of the RG.

    12: |
      The RG, its drivers and any packaged software SHOULD support Macintosh
      OS 8.6 and above.

    13: |
      The RG, its drivers and any packaged software SHOULD support all
      Microsoft PC based operating systems that have not yet reached "End of
      Support" status (see <http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle> for more
      details).

    14: |
      The RG, its drivers and any packaged software MAY support Linux. It is
      especially desirable to do so with an open interface.

    15: |
      The RG MUST preserve its configuration across firmware updates.

    16: |
      All software revisions SHOULD be backward compatible with all previous
      versions. There SHOULD be no loss of existing functionality.

    17: |
      Software revisions MUST NOT require service provider network changes to
      maintain proper operation of previous features.

    18: |
      The RG firmware MUST be identified by a revision number. This revision
      number MUST be formatted using an X.Y.Z incremental numbering format
      where X indicates the major release number, Y indicates the minor
      release number, and Z represents the revision number (e.g. 2.4.1).

    19: |
      The RG vendor SHOULD have a web site where firmware updates and
      documentation are available.

    20: |
      The firmware at the RG vendor's web site SHOULD include all error
      correcting updates for the RG.

    21: |
      The RG MUST NOT allow "back door" entry to the unit (e.g. there must be
      no hidden telnet or web access using secret passwords).

      This requirement is not intended to preclude physically secured craft
      access in accordance with GEN.DESIGN.14.

    22: |
      All firmware updates MUST be verified using security mechanisms. A
      checksum mechanism is a minimum requirement for achieving this.

    23: |
      All firmware updates SHOULD be signed with a cryptographic "fingerprint"
      of at least 256 bits.

    24: |
      In the event of a failure occurring during an update, the RG MUST be
      able to back off to the prior version of the firmware installed on the
      RG. That is, the prior version of the RG's firmware MUST continue to be
      useable in the event that a firmware update fails to complete.

      This is not a requirement for a dual image, although that is one manner
      in which this requirement might be satisfied.
