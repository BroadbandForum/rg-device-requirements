    IGMP and Multicast in Bridged Configurations (IPv4)

  requirements:
    1: |
      If the RG is in a bridge type architecture and an IGMP querier is
      supported in the access network, the RG MUST support IGMP snooping per
      IP bridge to an individual LAN addressable port or interface level (each
      Ethernet port, USB (PC), Wi-Fi, etc.). On each interface, the RG MUST
      forward only the multicast groups explicitly requested by that
      interface. A recommended reference implementation can be found in IETF
      RFC 4541 [@RFC4541].
