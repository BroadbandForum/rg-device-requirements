    The 5G-WWC set of requirements define a WAN behavior that is exclusive of the other behaviors defined in TR-124. For WWC this is referred to as 5G-RG mode of operation, and the non 5G behaviors are referred to as the FN-RG mode of operation. A device may be configured to exclusively use one mode of operation or the other, or may be a hybrid of the two via either VLAN or Ethertype separation of WAN traffic into distinct interfaces presenting a mix of 5G and non 5G interfaces to the device.

    The following table illustrates the set of common and mode specific
    functionalities between the two modes of operation.

    It is recommended that implementers read TR-470 [@TR-470] 5G FMC
    Architecture Overview in conjunction with interpreting these
    requirements; in particular, the section 5G-RG Overview of Operation.

  requirements:
    1: |
      An RG that implements both modes of operation SHOULD be able to support
      both modes of operation simultaneously.

    2: |
      An RG that implements both modes of operation MUST be able to be
      configured to disable the 5G-RG mode of operation

    3: |
      An RG that implements both modes of operation MUST be able to be
      configured to disable the FN-RG mode of operation

    4: |
      The RG SHOULD support URSP as specified in 3GPP TS 23.503 [@3GPP-TS.23.503] with
      modification specified in 3GPP TS 23.316 [@3GPP-TS.23.316].

    5: |
      The RG MUST support the 3GPP network slicing as defined in
      3GPP TS.23.501 [@3GPP-TS.23.501] clause 5.15 where the UE is replaced by the 5G-RG.

    6: |
      The RG MUST support the 3GPP NSSAI configuration and NSSAI storage
      aspects as defined in TS 3GPP TS.23.501 [@3GPP-TS.23.501] clause 5.15.4 where the UE is
      replaced by the 5G-RG.

    7: |
      The RG MUST support to retrieve Configuration and Management from
      Controller or from ACS via PDU Session as specified in clause 9.6 of
      3GPP TS 23.316 [@3GPP-TS.23.316].
